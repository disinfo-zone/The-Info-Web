The [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] was the diplomatic mission of the [[United States]] to the [[Soviet Union]] (and later [[Russia]]). It became a focal point of Cold War espionage and a significant location in the history of U.S. government investigations into psychic phenomena and electromagnetic warfare.[^1]

From 1956 to 1976, the embassy was subjected to the [[Moscow Signal]], a microwave beam directed at its upper floors by the Soviets. U.S. intelligence suspected this was an electromagnetic weapon designed to influence or degrade the health and behavior of embassy personnel. This led to classified U.S. research programs like [[Project Pandora]] to study and counter its effects. Embassy employees experienced various non-specific symptoms, including headaches, inability to concentrate, and fatigue, and later, some died of cancer, raising concerns about the long-term health impacts of the signal.[^1]

In the early 1980s, the construction of a new U.S. Embassy building in Moscow became another intelligence concern. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] received intelligence that the new embassy had been bugged at its core, with sensors embedded deep inside the structural framing materials. [[Joe McMoneagle]], a remote viewer from the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], accurately remote-viewed the building, perceiving it to be riddled with thousands of bugs and metallic decoys, including girders welded into antennas. This was later confirmed by a CIA/[[NSA]] investigation, revealing a massive Soviet eavesdropping and surveillance program.[^1]
