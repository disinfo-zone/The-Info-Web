[[China]] is a country in East Asia. During the Cold War, it was a significant player in global geopolitics, often viewed as a rival or potential ally by both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].[^1]
## Nuclear Program
China's nuclear program was a subject of intense interest for U.S. intelligence. In the late summer of 1979, [[Mel Riley]] and [[Joe McMoneagle]], remote viewers from the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program, successfully remote-viewed a new Chinese nuclear device at Lop Nor. Their descriptions, including an unusual hourglass-shaped design element, were later confirmed by U.S. weapons analysts, demonstrating the efficacy of remote viewing in intelligence gathering.[^1]

## Diplomatic Relations
President [[Richard Nixon]]'s historic visit to China in 1972 marked a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy, opening relations between the two countries. However, intelligence concerns persisted. For example, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] investigated the Chinese Embassy in a foreign capital, suspecting its basement communications office, and later tasked [[Pat Price]] to remote-view a Chinese consular building in Rome.[^1]
