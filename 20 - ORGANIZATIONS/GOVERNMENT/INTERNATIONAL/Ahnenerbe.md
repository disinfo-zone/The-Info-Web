The [[Ahnenerbe]] was a [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] think tank that operated as a research institute for the archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race. It was founded by [[Heinrich Himmler]], who served as its president and overlord.[^1]

The Ahnenerbe's mission was to prove the superiority of the Nazi ideology by linking it to ancient Teutonic culture. To this end, it conducted a wide range of research, from archaeology and geology to more esoteric subjects like extrasensory perception, astrology, and map dowsing. The captured documents from the Ahnenerbe's research on these unusual subjects are believed to have been a catalyst for the psychic arms race between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] after World War II.[^1]
