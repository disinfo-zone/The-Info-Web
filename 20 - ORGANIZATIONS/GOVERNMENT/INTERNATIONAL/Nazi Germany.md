[[Nazi Germany]] is the common English name for [[Germany]] between 1933 and 1945, when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party controlled the country. During this period, the Nazi regime was responsible for the Holocaust and was a major belligerent in World War II.[^1]

In the context of psychic research, Nazi Germany had a complex and often contradictory relationship with the paranormal. While the regime officially banned occult practices, figures like [[Heinrich Himmler]] were deeply interested in the supernatural and established organizations like the [[Ahnenerbe]] to research and exploit such phenomena for political and military purposes. The capture of Ahnenerbe documents by the Allies after the war is believed to have influenced the development of psychic research programs in both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].[^1]
