The [[Shas Party]] is an orthodox political party in [[Israel]], which emerged as a significant force in Israeli politics. It was at odds with [[Menachem Schneerson]], the Lubavitcher Rebbe, and gained influence within the [[Likud Party]]-controlled Israeli government.

In 1987, the [[Iran-Israel Joint Committee]] redirected funds from the Lubavitcher yeshivahs to the Shas yeshivahs, as the committee and [[Menachem Schneerson|Schneerson]] parted ways. The [[Likud Party]] considered the support of [[Ovadia Yousef]], an Iraqi-Jewish rabbi who controlled Shas, essential due to his large following in [[Israel]]'s Middle Eastern Jewish communities.[^1]
