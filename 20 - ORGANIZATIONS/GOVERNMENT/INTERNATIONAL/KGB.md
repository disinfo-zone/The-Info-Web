The [[KGB]] was the main security agency for the [[Soviet Union]] from 1954 until 1991, serving as its intelligence agency, secret police, and border guard. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, the KGB was deeply interested in [[Parapsychology|psi]] phenomena and was reported to have funded and directed psi research laboratories, such as that of [[I. M. Kogan]].[^1]

The 1972 [[Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR]] report by the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] explicitly stated that the "major impetus behind the Soviet drive to harness the possible capabilities of telepathic communication, telekinetics, and bionics are said to come from the Soviet military and the KGB." The report even outlined potential threats, such as the KGB knowing the contents of top-secret U.S. documents or molding the thoughts of U.S. leaders at a distance.[^1]

[[Uri Geller]] claimed to have worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Mexico City station, spying on local Soviet case officers, their agents, and the dead-drop sites they used, and attempting to convince Mexican officials to reduce the KGB presence. [[Ken Bell]] and [[Joe McMoneagle]] also successfully remote-viewed a KGB "illegal" in South Africa, revealing his method of decoding messages using a hidden pocket calculator and his use of a fishing pole to retrieve dead-drop packages.[^1]
