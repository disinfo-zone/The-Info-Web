[[French Intelligence]] refers to the various intelligence agencies of [[France]]. While not directly involved in the U.S. psychic research programs, French intelligence services were indirectly linked to the early Cold War "psi race" through figures like [[Jacques Bergier]]. Bergier, a consulting editor with alleged connections to French intelligence, is believed to have been the source of the fabricated "[[The Nautilus]]" story, which inadvertently spurred Soviet psi research.[^1]
