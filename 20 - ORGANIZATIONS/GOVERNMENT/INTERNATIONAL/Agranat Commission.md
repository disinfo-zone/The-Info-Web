The [[Agranat Commission]] was a commission appointed by the [[Israel|Israeli]] prime minister in 1974 to investigate the intelligence failures of the 1973 war, where [[Israel]] was surprised by the [[Syria|Syrian]]-[[Egypt|Egyptian]] attack on [[Yom Kippur]].[^1]

Several important recommendations from the commission's secret report were implemented immediately. One key recommendation converted [[Israeli Military Intelligence]] into the senior intelligence agency, granting it more powers than [[Mossad]]. As a result, the National Assessment of the immediate security situation became solely the responsibility of the director of [[Israeli Military Intelligence]].[^1]

A further effect of the recommendations was the creation of the External Relations Department of [[Israeli Military Intelligence]] (IDF/MI/ERD), built around an existing unit called Foreign Liaison.[^1]
