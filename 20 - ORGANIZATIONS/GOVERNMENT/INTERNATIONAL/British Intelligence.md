[[British Intelligence]] refers to the various intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom, including the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). During World War II, British Intelligence engaged in a variety of unconventional warfare tactics, including the use of black propaganda and psychological operations.[^1]

One notable example was the use of astrologers like [[Sybil Leek]] and [[10 - PEOPLE/(A-G)/Louis de Wohl]] to spread disinformation and influence the behavior of high-ranking Nazi officials. These operations highlight the willingness of intelligence agencies to exploit beliefs in the paranormal for strategic advantage.[^1]
