Obviously this is an enormous organization within the larger umbrella of the [[Department of Defense]] and well beyond the scope of a single information page. With that said, the U.S. Army is deeply ingrained as one of the locuses of power within the United State due in large part of it's abilities to directly inflict violence globally as well as direct hundreds of billions of dollars in funding annually. 

The ability of the Army, like all governmental programs entrusted with some semblance of “defense” or related critical task, to classify programs makes it’s activities and actions hard to discern and attractive to individuals looking to shield information and related materials from inquisitive eyes.
