# Walter Reed Army Institute of Research

The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) is a biomedical research laboratory of the [[U.S. Army]]. It was involved in classified research related to the [[Moscow Signal]] and [[Project Pandora]] during the [[Cold War]][^1].

An elaborate facility was constructed inside WRAIR, specifically at its Forest Glen Section, where scientists from [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]] irradiated primates with microwave beams. This research aimed to duplicate the effects of the Moscow Signal, an [[Electromagnetic Weapons|electromagnetic weapon]] believed to be aimed at the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] by the [[Soviet Union]][^1].

[[Richard S. Cesaro]] of [[ARPA]], who was in charge of Project Pandora, became convinced that these microwave beams adversely affected the internal organs of primates, including the brain, and could lead to conditions like [[Alzheimer's Disease]][^1].

Later, in the 1990s, [[David Morehouse]] was transferred to the psychiatric ward at Womack Army Hospital at Fort Bragg, after a period at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington for psychiatric evaluation. The Walter Reed Army Medical Center Sanity Board concluded that Morehouse did not have a severe mental disease or defect, but rather major depression and alcohol abuse[^1].
