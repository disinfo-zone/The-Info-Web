The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) is a major intelligence agency of the United States, specializing in defense and military intelligence. The DIA played a significant role in the oversight and funding of the [[STARGATE PROJECT]], particularly after the Army's initial involvement.[^1]

In March 1979, when [[Jimmy Carter]] decided to provide [[Israel]] with KH-11 satellite photographs, the images, once processed, were to be picked up by Israeli military attachés at a special Pentagon office controlled by the DIA. This arrangement was designed to provide [[Israel]] with intelligence and warning (I&W) regarding military activity within one hundred miles of its borders, but with the caveat that no intelligence would be provided to help them plan preemptive strikes.[^2]

Following the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak]] in June 1981, [[William J. Casey]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Director of Central Intelligence, authorized a review of [[Israel]]'s use of the KH-11 intelligence-sharing agreement. This review found that [[Israel]] had significantly expanded the agreement, leading to anger within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and DIA over the "very lax" management of the liaison agreement.[^2]

## Involvement in Psi Research:
The DIA's interest in psi research was driven by concerns over perceived Soviet advancements in the field. A 1972 DIA report, *Controlled Offensive Behavior—USSR*, highlighted the potential threat of Soviet psi capabilities, including the ability to access top-secret documents, influence thoughts, and disable military equipment remotely. This report, while alarmist to some, contributed to the impetus for U.S. investment in psychic research.[^1]

#### Oversight of Stargate Project:
[[Jack Vorona]], the head of the DIA's Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate, was the overall manager of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program. He, along with General [[Ed Tompson]], briefed Congressman Charlie Rose on the program in the late 1970s. The DIA continued to oversee the program even after the Army's funding was initially terminated in 1985.[^1]
