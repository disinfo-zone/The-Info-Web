The [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) is a major intelligence agency of the United States, specializing in defense and military intelligence. The DIA played a significant role in the oversight and funding of the [[STARGATE PROJECT]], particularly after the Army's initial involvement.[^1]

In March 1979, when [[Jimmy Carter]] decided to provide [[Israel]] with KH-11 satellite photographs, the images, once processed, were to be picked up by Israeli military attachés at a special Pentagon office controlled by the DIA. This arrangement was designed to provide [[Israel]] with intelligence and warning (I&W) regarding military activity within one hundred miles of its borders, but with the caveat that no intelligence would be provided to help them plan preemptive strikes.[^2]

Following the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak]] in June 1981, [[William J. Casey]], [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Director of Central Intelligence, authorized a review of [[Israel]]'s use of the KH-11 intelligence-sharing agreement. This review found that [[Israel]] had significantly expanded the agreement, leading to anger within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and DIA over the "very lax" management of the liaison agreement.[^2]

## Involvement in Psi Research:
The DIA's interest in psi research was driven by concerns over perceived Soviet advancements in the field. A 1972 DIA report, *Controlled Offensive Behavior—USSR*, highlighted the potential threat of Soviet psi capabilities, including the ability to access top-secret documents, influence thoughts, and disable military equipment remotely. This report, while alarmist to some, contributed to the impetus for U.S. investment in psychic research.[^1]

#### Oversight of Stargate Project:
[[Jack Vorona]], the head of the DIA's Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate, was the overall manager of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program. He, along with General [[Ed Tompson]], briefed Congressman Charlie Rose on the program in the late 1970s. The DIA continued to oversee the program even after the Army's funding was initially terminated in 1985.[^1]

## Role in Modern UAP Investigation

The DIA was the original home of the [[Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program]] (AAWSAP), the precursor to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP). AAWSAP was established within the DIA in 2007 with a $22 million appropriation from Congress. The program was led by [[Dr. James Lacatski]], a DIA rocket scientist, and it was responsible for investigating the threat posed by [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP). The program initially enjoyed the support of DIA leadership, including Director Lieutenant General Michael D. Maples and Deputy Director Robert Cardillo.[^3]

However, as new leadership took over at the DIA, the program began to face significant opposition. According to [[Luis Elizondo]], the new leadership, which included former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officials, was hostile to the program's investigation of the paranormal and theological aspects of the UAP phenomenon. This internal resistance ultimately led to the program losing its official support and funding, and it was forced to operate in a more clandestine manner under the leadership of [[Luis Elizondo]].[^3]

### The Wilson-Davis Memo

The DIA is also central to the events described in the [[Wilson-Davis Memo]]. The memo details a 2002 conversation between [[Eric Davis]] and Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson, who was then the Director of the DIA. In the memo, Admiral Wilson describes his discovery of and subsequent denial of access to a secret UAP reverse-engineering program, highlighting the fact that even the Director of the DIA was not cleared to know about the so-called "Legacy Program."[^3]
