Task Force 157 was a small, undercover U.S. Navy intelligence unit. During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], operating in the waters of the [[Bosporus]] off [[Turkey]], it relayed data to [[Washington D.C.]] suggesting that one of the Soviet ships leaving the [[Black Sea]] en route to the [[Mediterranean]] was carrying radioactive material. This report swept through the American intelligence community and the White House, contributing to the heightened alert status during the crisis.[^1]
