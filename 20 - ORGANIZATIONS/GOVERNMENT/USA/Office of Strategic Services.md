The [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) was a wartime intelligence agency of the [[United States]] during World War II. It was formed in 1942 to collect and analyze strategic information required by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and to conduct special operations not assigned to other agencies. The OSS was a precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], which was established in 1947.[^1]

Figures like [[Oliver J. Caldwell]] were former OSS officers who later became involved in intelligence activities related to psychic research, highlighting the continuity of personnel and interests across different intelligence organizations.[^1]
