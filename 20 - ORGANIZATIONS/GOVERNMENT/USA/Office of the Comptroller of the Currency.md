The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is a U.S. government agency responsible for regulating and supervising all national banks and federal savings associations.[^1]

### Involvement in BCCI Scandal

In February 1978, an OCC officer, [[Joseph E. Vaez]], submitted a report on the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] that characterized it as a bank dangerously out of control.[^1] The OCC claimed to have "lost" this memo, and only released it after a congressional subpoena.[^2]
