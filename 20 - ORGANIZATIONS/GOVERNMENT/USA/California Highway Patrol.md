The [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] is the state police agency of [[California]]. It was involved in the investigation of the "Queen's accident" on March 5, 1983, a head-on collision involving a Mariposa County Sheriff's vehicle and a Secret Service car. [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] Assistant Chief [[Richard Hanna]] reported on the collision, and [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] Sergeant [[Bob Schilly]] provided details about the accident.[^1]

The original [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] report on the "Queen's accident" was sent to the [[California Attorney General's Office|State Attorney General's office]] ([[John Van de Kamp]]) in Sacramento. However, [[John Van de Kamp]] reportedly told his assistant to "discard" or "trash" the report. All of the "crack M.A.I.T.S. team" [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] officers involved in the original investigation either resigned or were transferred or fired afterward. The [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] Commander and the Deputy Commander who supervised the M.A.I.T.S. investigation also resigned.[^1]
