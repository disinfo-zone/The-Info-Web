[[Fort Meade]] (officially Fort George G. Meade) is a United States Army installation located in Maryland, approximately twenty-five miles northeast of Washington, D.C. It is a sprawling, town-like base that houses, among other things, the [[NSA]], the U.S. First Army, and a part of the Army's [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM).[^1]

Fort Meade served as a primary location for the [[STARGATE PROJECT]], the U.S. Army's secret psychic research program. The remote viewing unit, initially codenamed [[STARGATE PROJECT|Gondola Wish]] and later [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]], was established here in 1977. The unit's offices were initially located in building 4554, and later moved to buildings 2560 and 2561 on Llewellyn Street, which were refurbished by the remote viewers themselves to create quiet, secure spaces for their sessions.[^1]

Key figures in the [[STARGATE PROJECT]], such as [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]], [[Murray Watt|Scotty Watt]], [[Mel Riley]], [[Joe McMoneagle]], and [[Ken Bell]], were stationed at Fort Meade. The base served as the operational hub for many of the remote viewing missions, with tasking requests originating from various offices throughout the U.S. intelligence community.[^1]
