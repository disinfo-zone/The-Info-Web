The [[All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office]] (AARO) is the official office within the United States [[Department of Defense]] tasked with investigating [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP). It was established by Congress in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and is the successor to the [[UAP Task Force]].[^1]

### Establishment and Mandate

The creation of AARO was a direct result of the legislative efforts of [[Christopher Mellon]], [[Luis Elizondo]], and a bipartisan group of senators and representatives who were concerned about the national security implications of UAP and the lack of transparency from the Pentagon. The office is mandated to synchronize efforts across the Department of Defense and other federal agencies to detect, identify, and attribute objects of interest in, on, or near military installations, operating areas, training areas, special use airspace, and other areas of interest.[^1]

AARO is required to provide regular briefings to Congress and to produce an annual public report on its findings. The establishment of a permanent, congressionally-mandated UAP office with a direct line of reporting to lawmakers is a significant step forward in the effort to bring transparency and scientific rigor to the study of UAP.[^1]
