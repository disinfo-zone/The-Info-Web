The [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]] is a bureau of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]] that collects and analyzes information about financial transactions to combat domestic and international money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial crimes.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] expressed a strong desire to communicate with someone from [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]], believing they had the necessary expertise to understand his claims about high-level financial illicit activities. He requested that [[J.H.]], an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent, connect him with a "technical guy that speaks my language" from [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]]. Riconosciuto claimed he could "unmask the whole operation" of how illicit cash flow was handled daily, including details about the [[Wackenhut Corporation|Wackenhut]] people, the [[Workers Bank]] in [[Colombia]], and "virtual dead-drops" used to circumvent ACH reconciliations.[^1]

Riconosciuto offered to reconstruct his files and provide [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]] with a day-by-day view of alleged Mob and [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Corporation illegal banking transactions. He specified the need for particular computer systems (VAX 11-730 and VAX 3900) to achieve this, claiming to know [[PROMIS]] and [[FOIMS]] (Field Office Information Management System) "inside out" and having helped develop their internal tracking audit trail. He also advised on how [[J.H.]] could make inquiries into his files without alerting the issuing agencies, suggesting "non-electric" filings on [[NCIC]].[^1]

Despite Riconosciuto's repeated requests and offers, nothing was forthcoming from [[J.H.]] regarding a connection to [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]] or entry into the Witness Protection Program.[^1]
