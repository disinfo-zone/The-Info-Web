The [[National Security Council]] (NSC) is the principal forum used by the President of the United States for considering national security and foreign policy matters with his or her senior national security advisors and Cabinet officials. In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program, the NSC was a key customer for remote viewing taskings, particularly during the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration.[^1]

During the late 1970s, the NSC, through staff members like Navy Lieutenant Commander Jake Stewart, tasked remote viewers with highly sensitive intelligence problems, including the remote viewing of a new Soviet Typhoon-class submarine under construction at the port of Severodvinsk. The accuracy of these remote viewing sessions, particularly those conducted by [[Joe McMoneagle]], sparked debate within the NSC regarding the value of psychic intelligence, with some officials, like [[Robert Gates]], remaining skeptical, while others, like Stewart, became strong proponents.[^1]

### Modern UAP Involvement

[[Luis Elizondo]] managed [[Special Access Programs]] (SAPs) for the NSC during his career in the [[Department of Defense]]. The NSC has been briefed on the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) issue by the [[UAP Task Force]] and its successor, the [[All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office]] (AARO). The involvement of the NSC highlights the fact that the UAP issue is considered a serious national security concern at the highest levels of the U.S. government.[^2]
