The [[U.S. Navy]] is the maritime warfare service branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, the Navy was involved in early rumors of a telepathy project with the USS Nautilus submarine, though this was later debunked as a fabrication or disinformation ploy.[^1]

More directly, the Navy had small contracts with [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] for psi research. The book also mentions a U.S. Navy A-6 attack aircraft that crashed, which [[Ken Bell]] successfully remote-viewed. Additionally, the secret [[NSA]] facility at Sugar Grove, West Virginia, which [[Pat Price]] accurately remote-viewed, was ostensibly a U.S. Navy communications base.[^1]
