The United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) was formed from the merger of the [[U.S. Army Intelligence Agency]] (USAINTA) and the [[Army Security Agency]] (ASA) which in particular was being used by the [[NSA]] as a source of readily available labor. INSCOM continues to collaborate with the NSA, but maintains more [[U.S. Army]] control of the process. 

This merger was organized at [[Arlington Hall Station]], VA and officially occurred on October 1, 1977. General [[William Rolya]] was the first commanding officer. The headquarters was moved to [[Fort Meade]] where the ASA and other groups were originally stationed.

The command engaged in [[remote viewing]] operations (under various codenames but referred to as [[STARGATE PROJECT]] for the purposes of this knowledge base) through at least 1981 under commanding general [[Albert Stubblebine]].
