The [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) is the modern name for the [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA). It is a research and development agency of the United States Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.[^1]

While the *Remote Viewers* text primarily refers to the agency by its earlier name, ARPA, DARPA continues to be at the forefront of advanced research, including areas that may touch upon human capabilities and unconventional intelligence methods.
