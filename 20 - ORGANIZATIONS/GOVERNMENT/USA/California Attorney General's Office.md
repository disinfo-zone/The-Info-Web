The [[California Attorney General's Office]] is the chief law enforcement agency for the state of [[California]]. It is mentioned in the context of [[Ron Van Meter]] reporting drug dealing and other forms of corruption within the Mariposa Sheriff's Department to this office in Sacramento. Upon his return, Van Meter was confronted by Sheriff [[Paul Paige]], who had been informed by the Attorney General of Van Meter's visit and its contents.[^1]

Three consecutive grand jury foremen sought help from the [[California Attorney General's Office]], but to no avail. [[Ben Wagner]], an attorney representing [[Dave Beavers]] and other deputies, learned that everything pertaining to Mariposa was automatically "trashed" when it crossed the Attorney General's desk. Wagner later filed a Writ of Mandamus against [[John Van de Kamp]], the State Attorney General, for refusing to investigate corruption in Mariposa County.[^1]
