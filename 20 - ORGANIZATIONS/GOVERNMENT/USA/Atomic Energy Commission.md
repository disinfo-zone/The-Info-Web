An Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) is a governmental body responsible for the oversight and regulation of nuclear energy and related activities within a country. These commissions typically manage nuclear research, development, and the production of nuclear materials, often with both civilian and military applications.

### Israeli Atomic Energy Commission

The Israeli Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1952. It was chaired by [[Ernst David Bergmann]] and operated under the direct jurisdiction of [[Shimon Peres]] and the Ministry of Defense. While publicly presented as being for peaceful nuclear research, its primary objective was the development of [[Israel]]'s nuclear weapons program.[^1]

### United States Atomic Energy Commission

The United States Atomic Energy Commission (USAEC) was an independent federal agency established after World War II, responsible for the custody of America's nuclear materials, operating nuclear reactors, and developing atomic bombs. Under the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration's Atoms for Peace program, the USAEC facilitated cooperation in the civilian uses of atomic energy, including financing and fueling a small nuclear research reactor at Nahal Soreq in [[Israel]]. This agreement included inspection rights for the [[United States]] to ensure nuclear materials were not diverted to weapons research.[^1]

[[Lewis Strauss]] served as chairman of the USAEC, followed by [[John McCone]]. Both were briefed on the Israeli nuclear program, though their responses and actions varied.[^1]
