The [[Pentagon]] is the headquarters of the United States [[Department of Defense]] (DoD). It is the central location for the command and control of the U.S. armed forces and has been the epicenter of the government's long and complex history with the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) issue.[^1]

### Role in UAP Investigation and Secrecy

The Pentagon has been the home of the official government programs tasked with investigating UAP, including the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP), the [[UAP Task Force]], and the current [[All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office]] (AARO). However, it has also been the source of the institutional resistance and secrecy that has surrounded the UAP topic for decades.[^1]

According to [[Luis Elizondo]], the Pentagon is a labyrinth of bureaucratic silos and competing fiefdoms, where information is closely guarded and new or controversial topics are often met with hostility. He describes a culture where the stigma associated with UAP has made it nearly impossible to conduct a serious investigation, and where those who have tried have faced ridicule, reprisal, and career-ending threats.[^1]

The building has been the site of numerous key events in the UAP disclosure movement, including the initial briefings of [[Christopher Mellon]] by [[Luis Elizondo]], the internal battles over the funding and future of AATIP, and the efforts to brief senior leadership like Secretary of Defense [[James Mattis]]. It is also where the infamous "GIMBAL" and "GoFast" videos were first analyzed by a small group of intelligence officials.[^1]

### The "Collins Elite" and the "Legacy Program"

The Pentagon is also alleged to be the home of two shadowy groups that have played a major role in the UAP cover-up: the "[[Collins Elite]]," a group of religious fundamentalists who believe the UAP phenomenon is demonic, and the "[[Legacy Program]]," a deeply hidden effort to reverse-engineer recovered UAP technology. These groups are said to have actively worked to sabotage official UAP investigations and to keep the truth about the phenomenon from the public and even from senior government officials.[^1]
