The [[Army Intelligence Agency]] (USAINTA) was a component of the [[U.S. Army]]'s intelligence apparatus. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, it is mentioned as merging with the Army Security Agency (ASA) to form the all-in-one [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|INSCOM]].[^1]

Brigadier General [[Edmund Thompson]] was the head of USAINTA before the merger, and later became the Major General and Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI) for INSCOM, overseeing the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program.[^1]
