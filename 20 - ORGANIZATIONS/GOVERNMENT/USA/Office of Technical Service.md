The [[Office of Technical Service]] (OTS) was a division within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] responsible for technical assistance to spying and covert-action operations. It was previously known as the Technical Services Division (TSD). OTS was often referred to as the "Q Branch" of the CIA, akin to the gadget-strewn division in the James Bond films.[^1]

OTS played a significant role in the early funding and management of the CIA's psi research, including the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]]. [[Ken Kress]], an OTS engineer, was responsible for giving [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] its first psi research contract in 1972. [[Norm Everheart]] served as the chief of OTS's regional "tech base" in Athens before becoming a liaison to [[Staff D]] and a key coordinator for [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] taskings from the CIA's Operations Directorate.[^1]

[[John McMahon]], the CIA's deputy director for operations, was also the head of OTS, indicating the importance of this office in technical and covert operations, including those involving psychic intelligence.[^1]
