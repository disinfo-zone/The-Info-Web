The [[Collins Elite]] is the name given by [[Luis Elizondo]] to a powerful, shadowy group of religious fundamentalists within the [[Department of Defense]] (DoD) who allegedly worked to sabotage the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and other efforts to investigate [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP).[^1]

### Beliefs and Opposition to UAP Investigation

According to Elizondo, the Collins Elite believes that the UAP phenomenon is demonic in origin. They view the craft and their occupants as a spiritual threat, deceivers who are in league with the devil. This belief system led them to actively oppose any government investigation into the UAP topic, as they believed that such research was dangerous and could be seen as an endorsement of demonic forces.[^1]

Elizondo recounts a direct encounter with a senior intelligence official who was a member of this group. The official told him, "It's demonic. There is no reason we should be looking into this. We already know what they are and where they come from. They are deceivers. Demons." This encounter, and others like it, highlighted the deep-seated religious opposition to the UAP investigation within the Pentagon.[^1]

### Influence and Impact

The Collins Elite is said to be composed of high-ranking, single-minded Pentagon and intelligence community lifers who have the power to shape policy and kill programs through their influence and anonymity. Their opposition was a significant factor in the internal resistance that AATIP faced, and it contributed to the program ultimately losing its official support and funding.[^1]

The existence of a group like the Collins Elite highlights the complex and often unexpected challenges that have faced the UAP disclosure movement. The intersection of national security, science, and deeply held religious beliefs has created a volatile and often hostile environment for those seeking to bring the truth about UAP to light.[^1]
