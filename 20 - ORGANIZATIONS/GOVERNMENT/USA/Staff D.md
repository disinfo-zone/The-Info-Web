[[Staff D]] was a cryptically named office within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] specializing in small-scale [[SIGINT|signals intelligence]] collection. It often worked closely with the Office of Technical Service (OTS). The chief of Staff D was [[Ed Rogers]], who was initially skeptical of incorporating psychic intelligence into operations due to the "giggle factor."[^1]

[[Norm Everheart]] was appointed as a liaison to Staff D, with the task of informing both offices of each other's activities and potential collaborations. Everheart encouraged Staff D to consider how remote viewers, particularly [[Pat Price]], could assist their operations. Despite Price's impressive demonstrations of remote viewing accuracy, Rogers ultimately decided against using psychic intelligence for high-stakes operations, opting for conventional technical means instead.[^1]

Staff D was later known as the Office of SIGINT Operations.[^1]
