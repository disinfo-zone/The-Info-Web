The [[Department of Defense]] (DoD) is an executive branch department of the U.S. federal government charged with coordinating and supervising all agencies and functions of the government concerned directly with national security and the [[United States Armed Forces]].[^1]

In the context of psychic research, the DoD played a significant role, particularly after the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s initial involvement. The DoD became the primary sponsor of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], overseeing its various phases and applications for military and intelligence purposes. Figures like [[William Perry]] and [[Richard DeLauer]] were involved in funding decisions for these programs.[^1]

The DoD's interest in [[Psi|psi]] phenomena was often driven by concerns about perceived advancements in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[China|Chinese]] psychic research, leading to programs aimed at understanding and potentially weaponizing these abilities. This included research into [[Psychotronic Weapons]] and the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation, as seen in [[Project Pandora]] and the work of scientists like [[Allan H. Frey]] and [[Robert O. Becker]].[^1]
