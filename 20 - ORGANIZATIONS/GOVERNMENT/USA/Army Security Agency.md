The [[Army Security Agency]] (ASA) was a [[U.S. Army]] organization responsible for signals intelligence and communications security. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, ASA was often treated as a "low-wage workforce" by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], which used ASA and other service personnel to staff its global listening posts.[^1]

In the summer of 1977, ASA merged with the [[Army Intelligence Agency|USAINTA]] to form the all-in-one [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|INSCOM]]. This amalgamation was, among other things, an effort by the Army to regain some control over its personnel who were often utilized by the NSA.[^1]
