The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) is the domestic intelligence and security service of the United States and its principal federal law enforcement agency. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, the FBI was aware of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program and occasionally sought assistance from its remote viewers for counterintelligence situations.[^1]

One notable instance involved an FBI official seeking [[Norm Everheart]]'s help to investigate a Soviet Embassy official who was using a fishing pole in a suspicious manner. [[Joe McMoneagle]]'s remote viewing session accurately revealed that the fishing pole was being used to retrieve a dead-drop package from a military installation wall, helping the FBI break an important case. This demonstrated the potential utility of remote viewing in law enforcement and counterintelligence operations, even if the FBI itself did not directly task the psychics due to internal skepticism or religious objections.[^1]
