The National Security Agency (NSA) is a U.S. intelligence agency primarily responsible for signals intelligence (SIGINT) and cybersecurity. The NSA became involved in the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program, particularly in tasking remote viewers with sensitive intelligence collection.[^1]

## Role in Satellite Intelligence

A former official of the NSA explained that the [[KH-11]] satellite, launched in December 1976, was considered the most important advance of its time in reconnaissance photography. Every military and civilian intelligence agency in the government had an urgent requirement for its imagery. The NSA was responsible for all communications intelligence and played a key role in managing the KH-11's schedule to maximize its intelligence collection and cost-efficiency.[^2]

However, [[Jimmy Carter]]'s decision in March 1979 to provide [[Israel]] with direct access to KH-11 photographs disrupted this careful scheduling. This decision was unpopular within the NSA and other intelligence agencies, as it meant less access to the satellite for American intelligence needs.[^2]

Later, during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration, it was learned that Israeli military officers were permitted to attend Pentagon meetings where future missions and orbital flight paths for the KH-11 were discussed. This caused significant dismay among some NSA officials, who felt it compromised the security and integrity of the highly sensitive KH-11 system.[^2]

## Involvement in Psi

#### Early Connections
[[Hal Puthoff]], a key figure in the [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] remote viewing program, had previously fulfilled his military service as a Navy officer at the NSA at [[Fort Meade]] in the early 1960s. He earned a Pentagon commendation for his work towards a future generation of high-speed optical computers.[^1]

While the NSA's direct involvement in psi research was initially limited, it became a significant customer of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program. The agency tasked remote viewers with various intelligence collection missions, demonstrating a pragmatic interest in the potential of psychic abilities.[^1]

*   **Soviet Bug Detection:** In 1980, an NSA liaison officer tasked [[Joe McMoneagle]] with locating a Soviet surveillance bug in a U.S. consulate. McMoneagle not only pinpointed the bug's location but also identified a Soviet listening post across the street and, surprisingly, an American NSA team counter-surveilling the Soviets.[^1]
*   **Typhoon Submarine:** The NSA was also a recipient of [[Joe McMoneagle]]'s remote viewing data on the new Soviet Typhoon-class submarine. Despite initial skepticism from some within the NSA, McMoneagle's detailed descriptions of the submarine's construction and features were later confirmed by satellite photography.[^1]

#### Security Concerns and Later Involvement
The NSA was at the center of the "Sugar Grove incident" in 1973. After [[Pat Price]] and [[Ingo Swann]] accurately remote-viewed a secret NSA facility in Sugar Grove, West Virginia, a security investigation was launched, highlighting the potential vulnerabilities of highly classified sites to psychic penetration. Despite this, the NSA later became directly involved in tasking remote viewers at both SRI and Fort Meade.[^1]

### Connection to PROMIS
Employed [[Bill Hamilton]] as a specialist in Vietnamese from 1962 through 1969.

In 1995, the NSA filed an affidavit in the [[INSLAW]] bankruptcy case, claiming that unspecified "national security" interests would be at risk if the case were allowed to proceed. This suggests a continued, albeit hidden, connection to the PROMIS software controversy and the alleged "backdoor" theory.[^1]
