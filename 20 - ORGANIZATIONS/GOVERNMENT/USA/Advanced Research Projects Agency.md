The [[Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (ARPA) was a U.S. government agency responsible for funding and overseeing advanced technological research. It is now known as [[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency).[^1]

In the early 1970s, ARPA showed interest in psychic phenomena, sending a three-man team to observe [[Uri Geller]] at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) in early 1973.[^1]

While ARPA's corporate stance was not to pursue further investigations into Geller, one of its team members, psychologist [[Robert Van de Castle]], was reportedly impressed by Geller's abilities.[^1]
