The Institute for Advanced Studies is a prestigious academic institution in Princeton, New Jersey. [[Lewis L. Strauss]] was a major contributor and fundraiser for the institute, and served on its board of trustees during World War II. In the fall of 1966, Strauss used his influence to get [[Ernst David Bergmann]] a two-month appointment as a visiting fellow at the institute, despite its usual focus on physicists and mathematicians.[^1]
