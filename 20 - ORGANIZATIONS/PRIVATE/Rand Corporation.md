The [[Rand Corporation]] is an American nonprofit global policy think tank. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, it is mentioned as being larger and more prestigious than [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] among scientific think tanks in the early 1970s.[^1]

Rand Corporation is also mentioned in relation to the early rumors of a telepathy project involving the USS Nautilus, though this was later debunked as a fabrication or disinformation ploy.[^1]
