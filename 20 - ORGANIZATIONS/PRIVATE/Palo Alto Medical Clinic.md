The [[Palo Alto Medical Clinic]] oversaw the medical and psychological evaluations for psychic subjects in the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) remote viewing program. These evaluations, which included a wide range of tests from blood work and EEGs to various psychological inventories, were designed to identify any neurophysiological or personality features that correlated with psychic abilities. The aim was to understand how psi worked, how it could be enhanced, and to develop screening tools for selecting psychics from the general population.[^1]

[[Pat Price]], [[Ingo Swann]], and other subjects underwent these extensive evaluations. Despite the comprehensive testing, no clear profile emerged for what made a good psychic, though hints suggested that talented psychics might be intuitive, non-judgmental, emotionally sensitive, and highly intelligent, with a proneness to altered states and EEG "asynchronicities."[^1]
