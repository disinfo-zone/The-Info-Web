The [[Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International|FGBMFI]] is an influential organization with a history of strong military connections and wide-ranging effects on foreign policy, particularly in Central [[America]] under the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration. Prominent right-wing activists, such as [[Joseph Coors]] (Heritage Foundation) and [[Sanford McDonnell]] (McDonnell Douglas Corporation), were members of FGBMFI.[^1]

### Political and Military Influence

[[Ronald Reagan]] had close ties with FGBMFI. In 1970, five FGBMFI members, including [[Pat Boone]] and [[Shirley Boone]], [[Harold Bredesen]], and [[George Otis]], prayed with then-California Governor Reagan at his home in Sacramento. [[George Otis]], a former Lear executive, reportedly spoke in the voice of God, comparing Reagan to a king and prophesying that Reagan would "reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue" if he continued to walk in God's way. Reagan reportedly took the prophecy very seriously. A Reagan Aide who later worked on [[Pat Robertson]]'s presidential campaign invited [[Nita Scoggan]], the wife of an FGBMFI member, to form a prayer group in the [[White House]]. [[Oliver North]] reportedly attended these prayer meetings.[^1]

Since 1964, FGBMFI held regular military prayer meetings in the Washington D.C. area, with three chapters, including one in the Navy Officers' Club. The Secretary of Defense even arranged for two prayer rooms to be built in the [[Pentagon]]. A 1986 FGBMFI brochure listed over a dozen military names, including the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Chief of Naval Operations, the Chief of Staff of the Army, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.[^1]

In Central [[America]], President [[Ronald Reagan]] supported [[General Ríos Montt]], a Pentecostal "true believer," who became president of [[Guatemala]] in an army coup in March 1982. Montt was aided and supported by Full Gospel businessman [[John Carrette]], a former Army Ranger in [[Vietnam]]. According to Carrette, the then-presidents of [[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Honduras]] were all Full Gospel.[^1]

### Connections to Jimmy Hughes and the Honduras Coup

[[Jimmy Hughes]] joined FGBMFI in 1987 and subsequently founded Jimmy Hughes Ministries – Free the Oppressed in [[Honduras]]. He openly admitted his past as a "Mafia hit-man" on the FGBMFI website. [[John Carrette]] "god-fathered" Hughes into the Fellowship and helped set him up in [[Honduras]].[^1]

Hughes was a high-standing member of FGBMFI and a keynote speaker at a dinner event in Fresno, [[California]], in February 2008, alongside [[General Daniel Lopez Carballo]] of [[Honduras]]. Hughes, [[General Daniel Lopez Carballo]], and [[Romeo Vásquez Velásquez]] were all members of FGBMFI. Hughes was allegedly involved in the planning of the [[Honduras coup]] in June 2009, which ousted President [[Manuel Zelaya]]. The interim de-facto president of [[Honduras]], [[Roberto Micheletti]], was placed in office by coup leaders [[General Daniel Lopez Carballo]] and [[Romeo Vásquez Velásquez]], both friends of Hughes and members of FGBMFI.[^1]
