Histadrut, also known as the General Organization of Workers in [[Israel]], is a powerful federation of labor unions that historically controlled a large segment of Israeli industry. [[Pinhas Lavon]] served as its head. The organization played a significant role in Israeli politics, particularly during the [[Lavon Affair]], where its internal disputes and the leaking of allegations to the press broke cardinal rules of Israeli politics.[^1]
