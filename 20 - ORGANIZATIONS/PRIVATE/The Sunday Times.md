*The [[Sunday Times]]* is a British newspaper. It struck a deal with [[Oscar Guerrero]] to publish [[Mordecai Vanunu|Mordecai Vanunu's]] story and photographs of [[Israel|Israel's]] nuclear facility. The arrangement included a Â£250,000 advance for [[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu]] on a book about [[Israel|Israel's]] nuclear capability, with [[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] receiving a 10% cut.[^1]

[[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu]] flew to [[London]] and was put up in various hotels while giving interviews to *The [[Sunday Times]]*. [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence, aware of the impending publication, attempted to discredit [[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu]] and later kidnapped him from [[Rome]]. *The [[Sunday Times]]* published the story and photos on October 5, 1986, after [[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu]] failed to return from his trip to [[Rome]].[^1]
