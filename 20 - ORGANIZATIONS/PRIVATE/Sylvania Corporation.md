The [[Sylvania Corporation]] was an American manufacturer of lighting products, televisions, and other electronic equipment. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, [[Russell Targ]] worked at the research laboratories of Sylvania Corporation before joining [[Hal Puthoff]] at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] to lead the remote viewing research program. This background in electronics and technology contributed to his approach to studying psi phenomena.[^1]
