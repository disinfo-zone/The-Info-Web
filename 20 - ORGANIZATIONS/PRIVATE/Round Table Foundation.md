The [[Round Table Foundation]] was a research facility founded by [[Andrija Puharich]] in Glen Cove, Maine, in the late 1940s. It was dedicated to the study of [[Parapsychology|psi]] phenomena, particularly [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]], and was funded by a group of wealthy patrons interested in the paranormal, including [[Alice Astor Bouverie]] and [[Marcella Miller du Pont]].[^1]

The foundation was housed in a 45-room mansion called the Warrenton Estate, and it was here that Puharich conducted his early research, including experiments with psychics like [[Eileen Garrett]] in a [[Faraday cage]]. The foundation also explored other areas of research, such as audio waves and human hearing.[^1]

The Round Table Foundation attracted the attention of the U.S. government, and Puharich was eventually called back into military service. The foundation's work, though often blending science with mysticism, played a role in the early history of U.S. government interest in psychic phenomena.[^1]
