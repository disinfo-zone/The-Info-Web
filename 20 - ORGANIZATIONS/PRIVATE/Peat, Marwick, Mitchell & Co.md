Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co was an accounting and consulting firm that eventually became Peat Marwick International in 1978. In 1986 PMI merged with KMG to form KPMG.

In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, PMMC (also referred to as PMM, PM&M, and PMM&C in various documents) was developing several computerized systems for various parts of the federal government including the Department of Defense[^2], Department of Transportation, Small Business Administration, and the [[LEAA]].

By 1972, the LEAA had paid PM&M $667,400[^1] in various grants. This includes the initial version of [[PROMIS]] which the firm began designing for the [[U.S. Attorney's office]] in 1969 under project manager [[Bill Hamilton]] (fresh from the NSA) with an initial $60,000 grant from the [[Office of Crime Analysis of the District of Columbia]] (through LEAA).

PMMC would receive further grants after the system went live in 1971 to create training and technical manuals and documentation to help other departments transfer to the system.

By the mid 1970’s, PMMC had over 25,000 US clients and more than 300 offices in 50 countries (the largest accounting firm worldwide). 21,000 employees and 1,400 partners across the global conglomerate. 9,300 of these employees were in the US with 65 percent of revenue coming from audit, 20% tax, and 15% consulting.
