[[Nugan Hand Bank]] was an [[Australia|Australian]] bank co-founded by [[Michael Hand]] and [[Frank Nugan]], along with officials of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-owned Air America. It was described as a primary CIA operation in the Pacific area.[^1]

The bank reportedly laundered profits from drug trafficking in the [[Golden Triangle]]. These laundered profits, in in turn, financed subversive paramilitary activities in Southeast [[Asia]]. The bank collapsed in 1980, $5 billion in debt, and [[Michael Hand]] subsequently disappeared.[^1]
