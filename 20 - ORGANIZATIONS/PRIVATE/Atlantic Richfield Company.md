Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) was an American oil company. In 1967, [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro]] and his partners were forced to merge their interest in the [[Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation|NUMEC]] into ARCO due to the continuing controversy over alleged uranium diversion. Shapiro, with his special Q clearance still intact, continued to run the plant.[^1]
