description: The Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was a key institution in the history of remote viewing, conducting research for the CIA and other intelligence agencies.

The [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) is a scientific research institute based in Menlo Park, California. In the early 1970s, SRI became the center of the U.S. government's secret psychic research program, which would eventually become known as the [[STARGATE PROJECT]].[^1]

SRI was a large and prestigious think tank, with close ties to Stanford University, and was primarily funded by government contracts, many of which were highly classified. This made it an ideal location for sensitive research into psychic phenomena.[^1]

The psi research at SRI was led by physicists [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]]. They conducted experiments with a number of psychics, including [[Ingo Swann]], [[Pat Price]], and [[Uri Geller]]. The research was funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), and other government agencies.[^1]

SRI was responsible for developing many of the key concepts and techniques of remote viewing, including [[Coordinate Remote Viewing]] (CRV) and the use of outbounder teams. The research at SRI was instrumental in convincing the intelligence community that remote viewing had the potential to be a valuable intelligence-gathering tool. Despite initial skepticism from some within the scientific community, Puthoff and Targ were able to publish some of their findings in reputable scientific journals, lending a degree of credibility to the field.[^1]
