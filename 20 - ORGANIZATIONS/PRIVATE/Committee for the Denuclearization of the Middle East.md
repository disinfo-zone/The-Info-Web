The Committee for the Denuclearization of the Middle East was a group of prominent Israeli scholars and scientists, including two former members of [[Ernst David Bergmann]]'s [[Atomic Energy Commission]], who privately banded together in late 1961. Their agenda was to stop [[Israel]]'s search for the nuclear option and to defuse the secrecy surrounding the activities at [[Dimona]]. In April 1962, the committee went public, stating that the development of nuclear weapons constituted a danger to [[Israel]] and to peace in the [[Middle East]], and urged [[United Nations]] intervention to prevent military nuclear production.[^1]
