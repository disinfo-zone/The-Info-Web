[[AiResearch Manufacturing Group]] was an American aerospace manufacturer and defense contractor based in Torrance, California. The company held numerous classified [[Department of Defense|DoD]] contracts, including those in avionics, hydraulics, and microprocessors. Notably, AiResearch engineered the life support systems for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo astronauts, giving it unique expertise in human physiology under extreme conditions.[^1]

In the context of psychic research, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contracted AiResearch to conduct a classified study on [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[ESP]], [[Psychokinesis]], and electromagnetic (EM) research. While AiResearch found much of the Soviet work to be "speculative, unscientific and sensationalistic," they identified a cause for alarm in Soviet efforts to enhance psychic functioning by bombarding test subjects with very high frequency (VHF) sound and pulsing the brain with electromagnetic signals. The goal was to bring humans to "the razor's edge between sleep and wakefulness" and to "facilitate hallucinations and altered states."[^1]
