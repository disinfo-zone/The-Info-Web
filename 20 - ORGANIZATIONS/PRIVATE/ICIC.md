ICIC (International Credit and Investment Company Holdings) was a [[Cayman Islands]] subsidiary of the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^1] It served as BCCI's repository for loans to privileged insiders.[^1]

### Role in BCCI Operations

ICIC was incorporated in 1976 and became the primary entity through which much of BCCI's illicit financial dealings took place.[^2] It consisted of three Caymanian entities: the BCC Foundation, the ICIC Staff Benefit Trust, and ICIC Business Promotions, which collectively owned about 41 percent of BCCI itself.[^2]

ICIC was used to conceal the bank's true ownership and financial manipulations. Billions of dollars in deposits were improperly diverted through ICIC, and it was a key mechanism for creating fictitious loans and rerouting deposits to cover losses.[^3] The worst of BCCI's account manipulation, particularly related to bad loans, was booked through ICIC.[^2]
