[[Eagle]] was an [[Israel|Israeli]] arms-dealing company. Its representative, [[Pesach Ben-Or]], was involved in helping the military regime in [[Guatemala]] set up a computer tracking system to fight the leftist insurgency. The company's operations in [[Guatemala]] were overseen by [[Ariel Sharon]] and his associate [[Mike Harari]] in [[Panama]].[^1]

In 1984, [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence, with the backing of the [[USA|Americans]], agreed to continue selling weapons to the [[Guatemala|Guatemalan]] government through [[Eagle]]. This was part of a deal that allowed [[Guatemala]] to be used for storing weapons en route to [[Iran]] and for planes carrying arms from [[Poland]] to the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]] to fly over [[Guatemala]].[^1]
