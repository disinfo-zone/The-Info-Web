[[Church's Fried Chicken]] is an American fast food restaurant chain specializing in fried chicken. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, Bill Church, a part owner of the chain and an amateur scientist, provided [[Hal Puthoff]] with ten thousand dollars in funding to begin his psi experiments at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. This private funding was crucial in the early stages of the remote viewing research program before the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] became involved.[^1]
