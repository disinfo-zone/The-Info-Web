The [[John Curtin Foundation]] was an organization in [[Australia]] whose funds were guarded by [[Alan Bond]]. In February 1987, a contribution from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] was made to the West Australian Labor Party, involving [[Richard Babayan]] and [[Earl Brian]] acting on behalf of [[Hadron]]. This money was passed on by one of [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell's]] companies in [[Australia]] to be held by the [[Pergamon Press Trust Fund]] in [[Moscow]], with [[Alan Bond]] receiving the check in his role as the guardian of the [[John Curtin Foundation]] funds.[^1]
