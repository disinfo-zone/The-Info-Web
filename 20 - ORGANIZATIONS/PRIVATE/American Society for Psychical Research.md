The [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) is the oldest psychical research organization in the [[United States]], founded in 1885 by the philosopher and physician [[William James]]. It is dedicated to the scientific study of [[Psi|psychic]] phenomena, including [[Telepathy]], [[Clairvoyance]], [[Precognition]], and [[Psychokinesis]].[^1]

In the early 1970s, the ASPR was one of the institutions where [[Ingo Swann]] participated in psychic experiments before his involvement with [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. [[Karlis Osis]], a parapsychologist at the ASPR, conducted experiments on [[Out-of-Body Experience|out-of-body experiences]] (OBEs) with Swann, where Swann claimed to be able to "float up" and perceive hidden objects. Osis also conducted a [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]] experiment with [[Pat Price]], where Price, from a distance, appeared to affect an infrared sensor in a sealed copper box.[^1]
