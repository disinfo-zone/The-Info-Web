Independence Bank of Encino was a financial institution illegally acquired by the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^1]

### Acquisition by BCCI

BCCI illegally acquired Independence Bank of Encino in October 1985 for close to $23 million, using [[Ghaith Pharaon]] as a front man.[^1] The true nature of the transaction was concealed when [[Swaleh Naqvi]] secretly funneled money to Pharaon through the Parisian [[Bancque Arabe et Investissement]].[^2]

Pharaon quickly installed BCCI personnel, including [[Kemal Shoaih]], as president.[^2] Independence Bank of Encino shortly ran out of capital and had to be rescued in 1991 with funds seized from BCCI.[^2]

### Legal Issues

Independence Bank of Encino was one of the three prominent U.S. banking institutions that the [[Federal Reserve Board]] fined BCCI $200 million for illegally acquiring control.[^1] It was also part of the indictment against BCCI and [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] in November 1991.[^3]
