The Israel Chemicals Company is the largest state-owned enterprise in [[Israel]]. [[Rafael Eitan]] was subsequently named to a high administrative position with this company, an appointment authorized by [[Ariel Sharon]], who had been named minister of trade and industry in 1984. This occurred after Eitan was tarnished by the [[Jonathan Pollard]] scandal.[^1]
