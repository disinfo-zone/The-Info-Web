The [[Cabazon Indian Reservation]] is located near Indio, California, and is home to the [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]]. Its sovereign nation status played a crucial role in a joint venture with [[Wackenhut Corporation]], allowing the parties to operate outside typical federal jurisdiction and congressional prohibitions.[1]

### Joint Venture with Wackenhut Corporation

On April 1, 1981, the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians formalized a joint venture with [[Wackenhut Corporation]], primarily to establish a production facility named "Cabazon Arms" on the reservation. This partnership was designed to manufacture high-tech arms and explosives for export to third-world countries, including the [[Contras]] in Nicaragua and nations in the Middle East, effectively circumventing U.S. arms export regulations.[1]

[[Dr. John Nichols]], the Cabazon tribal administrator and a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, was instrumental in this venture. He obtained a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] secret facility clearance for the reservation to conduct various research projects. Nichols proposed to Wackenhut the production of a range of weapons systems, such as 120mm combustible cartridge cases, 9mm machine pistols, laser-sighted assault weapons, sniper rifles, and portable rocket systems. The joint venture also explored the development of biological weapons.[1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] served as the Director of Research for this joint venture. He claimed to have modified the proprietary [[PROMIS]] computer software at the Wackenhut facility on the reservation. This modified software, allegedly made available by [[Earl Brian]] through [[Peter Videnieks]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], was intended for worldwide implementation in law enforcement and intelligence agencies, leading to the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]].[1]

Frequent visitors to the Wackenhut-Cabazon joint venture included [[Peter Videnieks]] and [[Earl Brian]]. The venture maintained close liaison with elements of the [[United States Government]], including representatives of intelligence, military, and law enforcement agencies.[1]

### Termination and Investigations

The Wackenhut/Cabazon Joint Venture was terminated on October 1, 1984. Following its termination, the activities conducted on the Cabazon Indian Reservation became the subject of numerous investigations by various governmental and law enforcement bodies, including the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], the [[United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee on Inslaw]], [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], as well as police agencies and media worldwide.[1]

Investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]] had planned to visit the reservation just days before his death, indicating its significance to his "[[The Octopus]]" investigation. His notes contained cryptic references to slow-acting brain viruses, like Mad Cow Disease, which he believed could be used against targeted individuals, and he was concerned he might have been a target of such a virus, linking it to activities at the reservation.[1]
