[[To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science]] (TTSA) was a public benefit corporation founded by musician Tom DeLonge of the band Blink-182. The organization's goal was to investigate [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) and other fringe scientific topics, and to educate the public about these issues through a combination of scientific research, entertainment, and publishing.[^1]

### Founding and Mission

Tom DeLonge founded TTSA in 2017 with the goal of bringing the UAP conversation out of the shadows and into the mainstream. He assembled a team of former high-ranking government officials and scientists to lead the organization, including [[Luis Elizondo]], [[Christopher Mellon]], [[Jim Semivan]], and [[Hal Puthoff]].[^1]

The company was structured with three divisions: Science, Aerospace, and Entertainment. The plan was to use the entertainment division to generate revenue that would fund the scientific and aerospace research. TTSA was instrumental in the public release of the three declassified UAP videos—"FLIR" (Tic Tac), "GIMBAL," and "GoFast"—which were posted on its YouTube page in conjunction with the 2017 New York Times article that revealed the existence of [[AATIP]].[^1]

### Role in UAP Disclosure

TTSA played a significant role in the early stages of the modern UAP disclosure movement. The organization provided a platform for [[Luis Elizondo]] to speak publicly about his work with AATIP after he resigned from the Pentagon. The company also produced the television show "Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation" on the History Channel, which featured Elizondo and other former government officials investigating UAP cases.[^1]

While the organization was ultimately not financially successful and many of its key members, including Elizondo, Mellon, and Puthoff, eventually moved on, TTSA was instrumental in raising the public profile of the UAP issue and helping to break the long-standing stigma surrounding the topic.[^1]
