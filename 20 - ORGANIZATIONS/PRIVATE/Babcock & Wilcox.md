Babcock & Wilcox is a major American reactor designer and manufacturing company. It took over the [[Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation|NUMEC]] plant in the early 1970s. In 1978, Babcock & Wilcox shut down [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro]]'s [[Apollo]] plant when the nuclear fuels business suffered a downturn. Under public pressure, the company agreed to keep the plant open to determine how much contamination existed. In 1989, the firm began to decontaminate the plant, an expensive process that involved the virtual dismantling of some areas. Company officials acknowledged that many sections of the plant, including its concrete floor, were so contaminated that they had to be dismantled, piece by piece, and buried at appropriate sites after the valuable uranium was removed.[^1]
