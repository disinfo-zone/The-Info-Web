[[Scientology]] is a body of beliefs and practices invented by American author L. Ron Hubbard. In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], several key figures involved in the early remote viewing research at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] were former members of Scientology, including [[Hal Puthoff]], [[Ingo Swann]], and [[Pat Price]]. This connection has led to speculation about the possible influence of Scientology's practices and theories on the development of early remote viewing protocols.[^1]
