[[Medan Computers Ltd.]] was the [[Israel|Israeli]] franchise of [[Honeywell]]. All its technicians were [[Israel Defense Forces|military intelligence]] reservists and computer experts. They were involved in the implementation of the [[PROMIS]] software in [[Guatemala]].[^1]

While the technicians at [[Medan Computers Ltd.]] were aware of the [[PROMIS]] program, they were not informed about the "trap door" functionality. When [[Medan Computers Ltd.]] pointed out that their computers would not be suitable for the [[PROMIS]] implementation in [[Guatemala]], they were arranged to act as brokers for [[IBM]] equipment in [[Guatemala]].[^1]
