[[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]] was a holding company associated with [[Robert Booth Nichols]], who was a principal in the organization. It was under investigation by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as a suspected "source of funding for the purchasing of narcotics/controlled substances and the allocation and use of the proceeds from its trafficking."[1]

Reportedly, [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]] functioned as a [[National Security Council|NSC]] cutout, used for the purpose of "funneling money to pay the board of directors." A friend of Nichols, who was once on the board, explained that the [[National Security Council|NSC]] operates as a "profit-making entity" with unlimited funding and no accountability due to national security considerations. This individual further stated that all covert business conducted at that time related to "money and/or drugs," with drugs serving as international currency, often referred to as "gold," due to the high market demand and profitability.[1]

[[Eugene Giaquinto]], then president of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] home entertainment division, was a board member of [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]]. Both Giaquinto and Nichols reportedly maintained a close working relationship with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], according to wiretaps.[1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] was also associated with [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]], serving as Vice President of Meridian Arms, a subsidiary of [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]]. He claimed that [[Robert Booth Nichols]] was under [[Harold Okimoto]] from the Hawaiian Islands, who was represented as an intelligence person and had worked under [[Frank Carlucci]] for years.[1]
