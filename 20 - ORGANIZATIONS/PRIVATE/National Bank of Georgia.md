National Bank of Georgia was a financial institution that became entangled in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] scandal.[^1]

### Acquisition by BCCI

[[Ghaith Pharaon]] finalized his acquisition of National Bank of Georgia from [[Bert Lance]] in January 1978, with the help of [[Agha Hasan Abedi]].[^1] Abedi paid off Lance's $3.5 million bank loan on the same day.[^1]

BCCI illegally acquired the National Bank of Georgia, using Pharaon as a front man.[^1] The bank's assets quadrupled from $400 million to $1.6 billion under [[Roy P. M. Carlson]]'s leadership, who was appointed head of the bank by Abedi and Pharaon.[^2] The National Bank of Georgia functioned primarily as a clearinghouse for BCCI funds in the [[United States]], a destination for BCCI letters of credit, and a provider of loans and services to BCCI's international clientele.[^2]

By 1987, the bank's share of the [[Atlanta]] retail market had dropped to 5 percent, and it began to suffer significant loan losses, requiring new capital infusions.[^2] [[First American Bank]] purchased the National Bank of Georgia from Ghaith Pharaon for $227 million in 1987.[^1]

### Legal Issues

The National Bank of Georgia was one of the three prominent U.S. banking institutions that the [[Federal Reserve Board]] fined BCCI $200 million for illegally acquiring control.[^1] It was also part of the indictment against BCCI and Abedi in November 1991.[^3]
