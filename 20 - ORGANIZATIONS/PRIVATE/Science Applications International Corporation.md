The Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was founded in 1969 by [[J Robert Beyster]] as Science Applications Incorporated (SAI). Beyster remained with the company, which was employee owned, until 2003 which paved the way to it’s 2006 initial public offering and 2012 split into two companies (SAIC and Leidos which is the core of the original SAIC).

During this period, SAIC operated through a unique structure of semi-autonomous divisions, allowing it to simultaneously pursue multiple classified programs for the [[Department of Defense]] while maintaining information compartmentalization. This structure would prove crucial in its later involvement with consciousness research and advanced physics programs.

The company initially focused on nuclear power and weapons effects study programs but expanded into: radiation therapy, development of the cruise missle (1970’s), cleanup of Three Mile Island, and even luggage inspection machines for the FAA.

[[Edwin May]] moved the [[STARGATE PROJECT]] in 1991 following [[SRI International]] stepping away. SAIC operated the project until 1994 at which point is was declassified in 1995.
