[[INSLAW|Inslaw Corporation]] is a software company that developed the [[PROMIS]] (Prosecutor's Management Information System) software in the early 1980s. The company was owned by [[Bill Hamilton]] and [[Nancy Hamilton]].[3]

Inslaw became central to a major scandal when it sued the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] for alleged non-payment on a version of PROMIS called Modification 12, and for allegedly pirating and modifying the software for sale to foreign governments, including [[Israel]] and [[Canada]].[3]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed to have installed a "back door" in the PROMIS software, which was then allegedly made available by [[Earl Brian]] through [[Wackenhut Corporation]] after acquiring it from [[Peter Videnieks]], a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] contracting official.[3]

The [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] became a significant focus of investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]]'s work, who believed it was connected to a larger network he termed "[[The Octopus]]."[3]

## FBI

In mid-1979, the [[FBI]] sought approval from Congress for acquisition of a new front-end processor (also known as a communications controller), a device that controls and manages the flow of messages into and out of the computer. In order to evaluate this request, the Senate Judiciary Committee asked both the [[OTA|Office of Technology Assessment]] (OTA) and the Institute for Law and Social Research (INSLAW) for an outside analysis.[^2]
