[[Bell Labs]] is an American industrial research and scientific development company, historically known for its innovations in telecommunications and computing. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, Bell Labs is mentioned in relation to the early rumors of a telepathy project involving the USS Nautilus, though this was later debunked as a fabrication or disinformation ploy.[^1]

More significantly, [[Robert Lucky]], the editor of the prestigious *Proceedings of the IEEE* electrical engineering society journal, was a Bell Labs scientist. He initially hesitated to publish [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]]'s paper on remote viewing but was later impressed after they visited Bell Labs to answer questions from skeptical scientists. Lucky eventually conducted his own informal remote viewing experiments and became convinced of its reality, stating, "Psychic stuff is really not much more far-fetched than some of the physics behind the laser."[^1]
