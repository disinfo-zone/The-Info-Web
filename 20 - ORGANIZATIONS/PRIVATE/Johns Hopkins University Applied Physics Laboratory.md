The [[Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory]] (APL) is a not-for-profit university-affiliated research center that serves as a technical resource for the U.S. government. In the context of the *Phenomena* text, APL scientists were assigned to oversee [[Project Pandora]], a classified program aimed at duplicating the effects of the [[Moscow Signal]] and studying the biological effects of microwave radiation.[^1]

APL conducted experiments where primates were irradiated with microwave beams similar to the Moscow Signal. Later, the [[State Department]] funded a $1 million study by the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, which found "no convincing evidence" that any employees suffered "adverse health effects" from the Moscow Signal, a finding that was controversial given the concerns raised by scientists like [[Richard S. Cesaro]] and [[Allan H. Frey]].[^1]
