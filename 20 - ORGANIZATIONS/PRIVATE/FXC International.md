[[FXC International]] was a company that initially produced parachutes for civilian purposes. It was transformed by [[Frank Chevrier]], who became its director and later owner. After Chevrier took control, [[FXC International]] began manufacturing parachutes for military purposes with [[Israel|Israeli]] technology.[^1]

[[FXC International]] had associates in [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], and other parts of the world. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] approached [[FXC International]] with the idea of opening an aircraft division, through which it could broker secret sales of aircraft around the world on behalf of the [[USA|U.S.]] government. Due to existing relations with [[Israel]], [[FXC International]] was used to "paper" [[USA|American]] equipment in what might have been perceived as illegal sales, allowing the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to closely monitor these transactions.[^1]

[[Joseph O'Toole]], managing director of [[FXC International]]'s aircraft sales division, was involved in negotiations to sell [[Chile|Chilean]] F-5Es to [[Iran]] through [[Singapore]]. [[FXC International]] was intended to act as a broker, buying planes from [[Chile]] on behalf of [[Israel]], thereby putting an [[USA|American]] stamp of approval on the deal.[^1]

[[FXC International]] was also involved in a deal to sell three C-130s to [[Iran|Tehran]], working with [[Richard St. Francis]] of [[TransCapital]] and [[Mike Timpani]]. [[FXC International]] was slated to receive $200,000 for the purchase of each aircraft and another $200,000 for each sale, with the [[Chile|Chilean]] government paying half its fee and [[Israel]] paying the other half.[^1]
