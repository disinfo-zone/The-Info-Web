The [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] was a financial institution that became embroiled in a major scandal involving money laundering, drug trafficking, and covert operations. Its collapse had far-reaching implications and was a significant focus of [[Danny Casolaro]]'s "[[The Octopus]]" investigation.[^1]

### Involvement in Illicit Activities

[[Adnan Khashoggi]], an international arms merchant, borrowed money for arms purchases related to the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] from BCCI accounts, with Saudi and U.S. backing.[^1] [[Lester Coleman]], a [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] covert intelligence officer, was paid in travelers checks sent from the Luxembourg branch of the now-collapsed BCCI.[^1]

[[Danny Casolaro]] was investigating the BCCI scandal as part of his broader "[[The Octopus]]" probe, believing it was interconnected with the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] and the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. He obtained papers referring to Iran-Contra arms deals, including photocopies of checks drawn on BCCI accounts for [[Adnan Khashoggi]] and [[Manucher Ghorbanifar]], from his confidante [[Bob Bickel]].[^1]

[[Bill Turner]], a friend and confidante of [[Danny Casolaro]], claimed to have seen papers from Casolaro that connected [[Oliver North]] and BCCI.[^1]
