Hadron, Inc. was a company that became central to [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s allegations of a high-level conspiracy to steal its [[PROMIS]] software and destroy [[INSLAW]]. [[Earl Brian]] had both a direct and indirect financial interest in Hadron. Inslaw alleged that the purpose of this conspiracy was to force Inslaw into liquidation so that Hadron could buy Inslaw's assets, after which the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] would award Hadron a "massive sweetheart contract."[^1]

Inslaw's conspiracy theory evolved over time, with later claims suggesting that DOJ employees delivered copies of Inslaw's proprietary software to Brian and Hadron before Inslaw's bankruptcy. These allegations posited that Brian was involved in various covert intelligence operations, and that DOJ officials gave Brian and Hadron copies of PROMIS to reward Brian for his role in the alleged "[[October Surprise]]" conspiracy.[^1]

Key allegations involving Hadron include:

*   **Dominic Laiti's Alleged Call:** [[Bill Hamilton]] claimed that [[Dominic Laiti]], Chairman of Hadron, called him in April 1983, stating that Hadron needed PROMIS for federal government contracts and intended to become a leading vendor of law enforcement software. Laiti allegedly threatened, "We have ways of making you sell." Laiti denied making these statements, and the Special Counsel's investigation found his denial credible, concluding no evidence supported Hamilton's claim.[^1]

*   **1983 New York Fundraising Trip:** Hamilton alleged that a 1983 Hadron fundraising trip to New York, involving Laiti, [[Paul Wormeli]], and [[Earl Brian]], was to raise capital to buy PROMIS. Laiti, Wormeli, and [[Marilyn Titus]] (Wormeli's secretary) all denied this, stating the trip was to raise capital for Simeon, a Hadron subsidiary, and had nothing to do with acquiring Inslaw or PROMIS. The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence to support Hamilton's thesis.[^1]

*   **Edward Hurley's Overtures:** Hamilton claimed that [[Edward Hurley]], a Hadron Vice President, stated in June 1985 that Hadron wanted to acquire Inslaw's "court software." While Theresa Bousquin, an Inslaw employee, confirmed Hurley's general interest in Inslaw's software, she stated his remark was made in passing and did not indicate an active effort by Hadron to acquire Inslaw. The Special Counsel's investigation found Hamilton's claim inaccurate.[^1]

*   **Accumenics Contract Award:** Hamilton alleged that [[James L. Byrnes]], a Deputy Assistant Attorney General with ties to [[Edwin Meese]], spearheaded a $40 million computer services contract award to a Hadron subsidiary (Accumenics) in October 1987. Byrnes denied any knowledge of such a contract or any contact with Hadron or its subsidiaries. The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence to support this allegation.[^1]

*   **Peter Videnieks Connection:** Inslaw alleged a connection between DOJ's contracting officer, [[Peter Videnieks]], and Hadron, claiming Videnieks was the contracting officer for two Customs Service contracts with Hadron. While [[John Schoolmeister]] suggested a possible meeting between Videnieks and Laiti, Videnieks denied ever being the contracting officer for any Hadron contract or meeting Hadron management. The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence of a conspiracy, concluding any connection was tenuous and insignificant.[^1]

*   **Attempted Purchase of Inslaw by SCT:** Hamilton alleged that [[Systems and Computer Technology, Inc.|SCT]]'s 1986 attempt to purchase Inslaw was encouraged by DOJ officials and indirectly linked to Brian. The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence to support these claims, noting that SCT's contacts with DOJ were for due diligence and that there was no apparent reason for Brian or Hadron to control Inslaw at that time.[^1]

*   **Lois Battistoni's Allegations:** [[Lois Battistoni]] claimed an unnamed DOJ employee told her Hadron was connected to a top DOJ official and was chosen to take over Inslaw's business. The Special Counsel's investigation found Battistoni's information unreliable and biased, with no corroboration for her claims.[^1]

Investigations by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Special Counsel found no credible evidence to support the allegations of a conspiracy involving Hadron, Earl Brian, and the DOJ to steal PROMIS or destroy Inslaw. The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicated no connection between Hadron and anything related to Inslaw or PROMIS software. The Special Counsel's report concluded that the individuals claiming direct knowledge of this conspiracy were "unworthy of belief" and contradicted by credible evidence.[^1]
