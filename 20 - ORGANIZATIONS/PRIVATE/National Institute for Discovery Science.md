The [[National Institute for Discovery Science]] (NIDS) was a privately funded research organization founded by billionaire [[Robert Bigelow]] in 1995. The organization was dedicated to the scientific study of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) and other paranormal phenomena.[^1]

### Research and Investigations

NIDS conducted research into a wide range of anomalous phenomena, including UAP sightings, cattle mutilations, and other paranormal events. The organization was known for its scientific approach to these topics, and it employed a team of scientists and researchers to investigate cases and analyze data.[^1]

One of the most well-known projects undertaken by NIDS was the investigation of [[Skinwalker Ranch]], a property in Utah with a long history of strange and often terrifying phenomena. NIDS conducted a multi-year investigation of the ranch, documenting a wide range of anomalous activity.[^1]

### Connection to AATIP

The work of NIDS was a precursor to the research conducted by the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP). When [[Robert Bigelow]]'s company, [[Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies]] (BAASS), was awarded the contract for the AATIP program, the research that had been started by NIDS was continued and expanded upon under the auspices of the government program.[^1]
