[[TransCapital Corporation]] was a [[Connecticut]] firm licensed to sell computer hardware, particularly for the [[PROMIS]] program. It played a role in facilitating arms deals and technology transfers.[^1]

In 1986 and 1987, [[TransCapital Corporation]] was allowed to export high-tech [[IBM]] computers to the [[Soviet Union]], despite a general ban on selling such equipment to the [[East Bloc]]. This was made possible by [[Robert Gates]], who lifted the barriers. When the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] desired [[PROMIS]], [[Degem]] technicians fitted it to the [[IBM]] computers, complete with the "trap door."[^1]

[[Richard St. Francis]], who worked for [[TransCapital Corporation]], was involved in a deal to sell three C-130s to [[Iran|Tehran]], working with [[Joseph O'Toole]] and [[Mike Timpani]]. This deal was intended to be a go-between for [[Israel]] and [[Iran]].[^1]
