Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) was a privately owned nuclear enriching plant in [[Apollo]], [[Pennsylvania]], owned by [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro]]. It was suspected by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and others of having smuggled more than two hundred pounds of weapons-grade uranium to [[Israel]], enough for four bombs. This alleged diversion was a major factor in [[Carl E. Duckett]]'s [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] estimates of [[Israel]]'s nuclear arsenal.[^1]
