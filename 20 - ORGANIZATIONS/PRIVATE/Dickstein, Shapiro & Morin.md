Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin was a law firm that represented [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] in prosecuting its adversary complaint against the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. [[Lee Ratiner]] was the partner in charge of the matter.

Inslaw filed an objection to Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin's application for fees, charging that the firm, due to pressure by the DOJ, forced Ratiner out and effectively abandoned [[INSLAW]]. Bankruptcy Judge James F. Schneider found no credible evidence to support Inslaw's charge, concluding that Inslaw's allegations of wrongdoing were "built upon supposition, suspicion and uncorroborated hearsay, all of which [are] unworthy of belief." The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations also investigated Inslaw's claim and found no proof of any DOJ pressure on the firm that affected its representation of Inslaw.[^1]

More recently, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] published a book in which he claimed to have seen evidence suggesting that the Dickstein, Shapiro firm was to be paid $600,000 by Hadron, Inc., or [[Earl Brian]] in order to remove Ratiner from the firm. However, the Special Counsel's investigation found this claim implausible given their conclusions about Ben-Menashe's testimony.[^1]
