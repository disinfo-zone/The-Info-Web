The [[Stern Gang]] was another name for [[LEHI]] (Lohamei Herut Israel, Hebrew for Fighters for the Liberation of [[Israel]]), a Jewish terrorist group founded by [[David Stern]] and later led by [[Yitzhak Shamir]].[^1]

[[Gourdji]], the father of [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], was involved with the [[Stern Gang]] in [[Palestine]] in 1940. The group was known for its virulently anti-British stance, with [[Yitzhak Shamir]] even willing to negotiate with the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] for Jewish lives. They were persecuted by British and [[USA|U.S.]] governments and the Jewish labor movement.[^1]
