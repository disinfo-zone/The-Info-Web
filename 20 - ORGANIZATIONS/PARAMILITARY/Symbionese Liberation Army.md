The Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) was a radical left-wing organization active in California in the mid-1970s. They are best known for the kidnapping of newspaper heiress Patty Hearst in 1974.[^1]

[[Pat Price]], a psychic at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI), was asked by the Berkeley police to assist in the investigation. Price correctly identified the kidnapping as a political act and picked out three members of the SLA, including William Wolfe (nicknamed "Lobo"), from police mugshots.[^1]

Price attempted to locate Hearst using remote viewing, but was unsuccessful. Hearst was eventually arrested with other SLA members in 1975.[^1]
