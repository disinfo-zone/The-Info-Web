The [[African National Congress]] (ANC) was a black revolutionary group in [[South Africa]]. It was targeted by the [[PROMIS]] software, which was implemented in [[Transkei]] by [[Degem]] (controlled by [[Israel|Israeli]] military intelligence) with the assistance of [[Robert Maxwell]].

[[PROMIS]] was used as a "killing machine" against the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and other black revolutionary groups, leading to the disappearance or maiming of almost 12,000 activists by early 1986. This was often carried out through "black-on-black" violence by death squads led by Chief [[Gatsha Buthelezi]], a term known in [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence circles as "Kushi kills Kushi." The system tracked dissidents through their required identity passes, and death lists were drawn up and handed over to [[Gatsha Buthelezi|Buthelezi]]'s group.[^1]
