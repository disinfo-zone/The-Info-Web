The [[Shining Path]] (Sendero Luminoso) is a Maoist terrorist group in [[Peru]]. It was founded and led by [[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso]], a former philosophy professor at the [[University of San Cristobal]] in [[Ayacucho]].[^1]

In 1980, [[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] proclaimed the armed struggle against the capitalist government in [[Lima]], leading to the [[Shining Path]] becoming a powerful force. The department of [[Ayacucho]] was declared under martial law by [[Alan Garcia|Peruvian President Alan Garcia]] due to the group's activities.[^1]

In 1988, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] met with [[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] to secure rare minerals for [[Israel|Israel's]] nuclear program. The [[Shining Path]] agreed to sell the minerals for $10 million and requested [[Israel]] to purchase the [[Ocho Group]] newspaper chain and provide medical equipment. The group's philosophy was a mixture of Inca and kibbutz ideology, with a focus on communal living and a unique perspective on social issues.[^1]

The [[Shining Path]] controlled significant areas of [[Peru]], particularly outside of [[Ayacucho]]. They were involved in ambushes against the military, and their actions led to the slaughter of innocent villagers by [[Rafael Cordova|Col. Rafael Cordova]] in retaliation. The group also used [[Stinger missiles]] to shoot down military helicopters.[^1]
