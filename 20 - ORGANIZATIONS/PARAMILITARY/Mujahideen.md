The [[Mujahideen]] refers to various groups of Muslim guerrilla fighters, particularly those who resisted the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] invasion of [[Afghanistan]]. They were supported by a worldwide network that included figures like [[Ralph Olberg]] and [[Tim Osman]], who were involved in procuring [[United States|U.S.]] weapons and technology for them.[^1]

Discussions with [[Ted Gunderson]], [[Ralph Olberg]], and [[Tim Osman]] in early 1986 focused on the Mujahideen's willingness to field test new and esoteric weapons and provide research reports with photos. They also discussed the capture and/or defection of high-ranking Soviet military personnel and the availability of their intelligence briefings. The Mujahideen were also linked to the exchange of arms for drugs, with cocaine or heroin being used as payment for weapons.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] was involved in discussions about analyzing a Soviet-directed weapons system called "[[Blue Death]]," captured by the Afghan rebels, to help develop effective countermeasures. There were also plans for a military joint venture in [[Turkey]] to produce specialized ammunition and a lobbying effort to legally obtain Stinger II missiles and their variants for the Mujahideen. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] was tasked with formulating a plan to sanitize the electronics of any Stingers at risk of Soviet capture.[^1]

[[Ralph Olberg]]'s arms assistance project to the Afghan rebels was understood to be legally sanctioned, operating through the State Department and Senator Humphrey's office. However, there was a "turf battle problem" with certain factions of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and their group, MSH ([[Management Science For Health]]), who questioned whether Olberg and Osman's group truly represented the leadership of the Afghan rebel resistance.[^1]
