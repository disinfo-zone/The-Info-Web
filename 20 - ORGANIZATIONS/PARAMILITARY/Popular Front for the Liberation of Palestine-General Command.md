The [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command|PFLP-GC]] is a Palestinian militant organization. It was implicated by the private investigative firm [[Interfor]] as being behind the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Interfor claimed that the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command|PFLP-GC]] was able to get their bomb on board the 747 because the flight was part of a heroin smuggling route connected to the Syrian regime and protected by both the [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration|U.S. DEA]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].[^1]

Allegations suggest that a suitcase intended for heroin was covertly substituted with explosives by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command|PFLP-GC]] and [[Monzer Al-Kassar]], unbeknownst to others involved in the alleged drug smuggling operation. The [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command|PFLP-GC]] also maintained camps in the Bekaa Valley in [[Lebanon]], which were targeted by [[Israel|Israeli]] air strikes in 1989.[^1]
