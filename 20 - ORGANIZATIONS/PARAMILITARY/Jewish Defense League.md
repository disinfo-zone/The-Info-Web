The [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL) is a [[New York]]-based extreme right-wing organization associated with [[Meir Kahane|Rabbi Meir Kahane]].[^1]

The JDL was implicated in the 1969 arson attack on the [[El Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]], carried out by [[Michael Dennis Rohan]]. [[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan]] claimed to have coordinated the deed with the JDL. [[Israel|Israeli]] interrogators, including those who questioned [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], emphasized the importance of not revealing the JDL's involvement to avoid any "traces of Jewish hands" in the incident.[^1]
