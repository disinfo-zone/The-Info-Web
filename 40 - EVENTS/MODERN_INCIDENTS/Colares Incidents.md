The [[Colares Incidents]] refer to a wave of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]] encounters that occurred in 1977 on the island of Colares, in the state of Pará, Brazil. These events are notable for their prolonged duration, the wide variety of craft observed, and the direct, harmful physical effects on the local population.[^1]

### The Phenomena

For several months in 1977, the residents of Colares and the surrounding region were terrorized by a series of intense UAP sightings. The objects varied greatly in shape and size, from small, luminous orbs to massive, city-sized craft. Witnesses reported flying discs, spheres, triangles, and cylinders. These craft would often buzz small towns and villages at night, bathing the area in bright light.[^1]

What distinguished the Colares events was the aggressive nature of the phenomena. Witnesses reported being chased by yellow orbs that would turn blue before firing a laser-like beam, causing burns and sometimes rendering the victim unconscious. These lights were known by the locals as "chupa-chupa," meaning "suck-suck," due to the belief that they were extracting blood from their victims. The beams were reported to be able to penetrate the tiled roofs of houses, intelligently searching for occupants inside. Some witnesses also claimed that larger craft attempted to abduct them using nets and hooks.[^1]

### The Investigation and Biological Effects

The Brazilian Air Force launched an official investigation into the incidents, codenamed Operation Saucer (Operação Prato). A team of twenty investigators and physicians, led by Lieutenant Colonel Uyrange Hollanda, was dispatched to the region. The team interviewed hundreds of witnesses, treated the wounded, and documented the events with photographs and film footage, capturing images of mysterious objects, including one estimated to be three hundred feet long.[^1]

Dr. Wellaide Cecim Carvalho, a physician treating the local population, documented the medical effects of the encounters. She treated approximately forty people with burns consistent with thermal or directed energy exposure. In twenty-three cases, she noted two puncture wounds at the center of the burns. Blood tests of the victims revealed low hemoglobin levels, lending credence to the "chupa-chupa" nickname. Other reported symptoms included chronic headaches, nausea, temporary blindness, and long-term illnesses. Tragically, ten people are reported to have died as a result of their encounters.[^1]

Witnesses who claimed to have seen the occupants of the craft described two types of beings: tall, pale humanoids (often referred to as "Nordics") and small, frail beings with large heads (often referred to as "Grays").[^1]

### Aftermath and Secrecy

The Brazilian government officially shut down Operation Saucer and suppressed its findings, claiming no unusual phenomena had been found. The files remained classified until the 1990s. Colonel Hollanda, the lead investigator, died of an apparent suicide shortly after the files were released. The case was later studied by [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]], with General Paulo Roberto Yog de Miranda Uchôa providing the program with access to the Brazilian military's archives on the incidents.[^1]
