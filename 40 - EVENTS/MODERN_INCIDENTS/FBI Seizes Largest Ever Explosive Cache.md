On January 1, 2025, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] announced they seized the "largest explosives cache in FBI history."

The FBI found more than 150 homemade pipe bombs and a short barrel rifle during a December 30, 2024 raid on [[Brad Kenneth Spafford]]'s farm in  Isle of Wight County in Virginia.[^1] 

Most of the weapons were found in a detached garage that also contained homemade fuses. A notebook contained lists of explosives and recipes for making HMTD, C4, grenades, etc. There was also a vest preloaded with pipe bombs and a homemade mortar.

In his freezer they found a jar of HMTD, a highly unstable easy to make chemical used for amateur blasting caps, etc.

A confidential human source (CHS) first tipped off the FBI in 2023 when they witnessed Spafford firing at a target of President Biden with an unregistered short barrel rifle and discussing how we need more political assassinations and that the government was kidnapping children and training them to be school shooters. The CHS kept in contact with Spafford through 2024 and received memes, etc endorsing violence that the CHS also provided to the FBI.

This culminated in October 2024 when the CHS visited Spafford's newly purchased farm while wearing a wire. The CHS was able to get Spafford to state he had the SBR and would not register it, that he had HMTD, ETN (a secondary explosive), and that he was going to fortify his property with a 50 caliber turret mounted gun.
