On January 1, 2025, active duty [[U.S. Army]] [[Special Operations Group|Special Ops Soldier]] [[Matthew Livelsberger]] parked a Tesla Cybertruck in front of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas in Paradise, Nevada. The truck was filled with firework mortars and gas canisters and was detonated at approximately 8:39am injuring seven bystanders.[^1] Livelsberger allegedly shot himself in the head seconds before the explosion. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] is still deciding whether to classify this as an [[act of terrorism]].
## Detailed Timeline
- The truck was rented in Colorado using [[Turo]] on December 28[^2]. Livelsberger texted a girlfriend that he felt like batman or “halo.”
- December 30, Livelsberger drove to Monument, Colorado and purchased two handguns
- December 31, Livelsberger drove through and charged at Trinidad, CO; Las Vegas, NM; Albuquerque, NM; and Gallup, NM.
- January 1, the truck is charged in Holbrook, Flagstaff, and Kingman, AZ (the last charge at 5:33 AM).
- 7:29 AM The Cybertruck is first spotted in Las Vegas
- 7:34 AM The Cybertruck is seen turning on to Fashion Show Drive, the location of the Trump International Hotel.
- Between 7:34 and 8:35 AM The Cybertruck pulled through the valet at the Trump hotel, then spent the next hour driving at several different locations along Las Vegas Boulevard. The truck spent nearly 45 minutes in the parking lot of a business near Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road.
- 8:35 AM The Cybertruck is spotted pulling onto Las Vegas Boulevard from Sands Avenue.
- 8:39 AM The Cybertruck again pulls into the valet area of Trump hotel. Within 17 seconds, the truck explodes. 
- Livelsberger allegedly shot themselves in the head immediately before the detonation
## Additional Details
One rifle and one handgun (a Desert Eagle) were found in the vehicle.[^6]

Authorities recovered two cellphones, a laptop, and notes[^3] from one of those devices. One note was titled “surveillance log” and detailed activity from Dec 21 to New Year’s.
> “Fellow servicemembers, Veterans, and all Americans. TIME TO WAKE UP! We are being led by weak and feckless [sic] leadership who only serve to enrich themselves.”[^7]

A second note stated in part:

> "We are the United States of America, the best country ... to ever exist, but right now, we are terminally ill and headed towards collapse," the letter said. "This was not a terrorist attack. It was a wake up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives. ... I need to cleanse my mind of the brothers I’ve lost, and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took." [^3]

The vehicle was allegedly never in self driving mode[^7]
## “Manifesto”
Livelsberger allegedly sent a “manifesto” to [[Sam Shoemate]] (@samosaur) on December 31, 2024[^4] alleging, among other things, that the [[New Jersey Drones|NJ Drones]] are Chinese [[anti-gravitic]] devices, that the United States also possesses this technology, that he is aware of war crimes committed in 2019 by the United States, and that he has TSSCI with [[UAP]] [[Special Access Programs|USAP]] access.
### “Manifesto” Text

^5630d3

> In case I do not make it to my decision point or on to the Mexico border I am sending this now. Please do not release this until 1JAN and keep my identity private until then.

> First off I am not under duress or hostile influence or control. My first car was a 2006 Black Ford Mustang V6 for verification.

> What we have been seeing with "drones" is the operational use of gravitic propulsion systems powered aircraft by most recently China in the east coast, but throughout history, the US. Only we and China have this capability. Our OPCEN location for this activity in the box is below.

> China has been launching them from the Atlantic from submarines for years, but this activity recently has picked up. As of now, it is just a show of force and they are using it similar to how they used the balloon for sigint and isr, which are also part of the integrated comms system. There are dozens of those balloons in the air at any given time.

> The so what is because of the speed and stealth of these unmanned AC, they are the most dangerous threat to national security that has ever existed. They basically have an unlimited payload capacity and can park it over the WH if they wanted. It's checkmate.

> USG needs to give the history of this, how we are employing it and weaponizing it, how China is employing them and what the way forward is. China is poised to attack anywhere in the east coast

> I've been followed for over a week now from likely homeland or FBI, and they are looking to move on me and are unlikely going to let me cross into Mexico, but won't because they know I am armed and I have a massive VBIED. I've been trying to maintain a very visible profile and have kept my phone and they are definitely digitally tracking me.

> I have knowledge of this program and also war crimes that were covered up during airstrikes in Nimruz province [[Afghanistan War|Afghanistan]] in 2019 by the admin, [[Department of Defense|DoD]], [[Drug Enforcement Agency|DEA]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. I conducted targeting for these strikes of over 125 buildings (65 were struck because of CIVCAS) that killed hundreds of civilians in a single day. USFORA continued strikes after spotting civilians on initial ISR, it was supposed to take 6 minutes and scramble all aircraft in [[CENTCOM]]. The UN basically called these war crimes, but the administration made them disappear. I was part of that cover-up with USFORA and Agent [redacted] of the DEA. So I don't know if my abduction attempt is related to either. I worked with GEN Millers IO staff on this as well as the response to Bala Murghab. AOB-S Commander at the time [redacted] can validate this.

> You need to elevate this to the media so we avoid a world war because this is a mutually assured destruction situation.

> For vetting my LinkedIn is Matt Berg or Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty 18Z out of 1-10 my profile is public. I have an active TSSCI with UAP USAP access.[^5]
