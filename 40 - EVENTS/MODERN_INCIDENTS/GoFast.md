The [[GoFast]] is one of the three declassified [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]] videos released by the [[Pentagon]] in 2017. The video, which was captured by the crew of an F/A-18 Super Hornet from the [[USS Roosevelt]] Carrier Strike Group in 2015, shows a small, fast-moving object that appears to be traveling at an incredible speed just above the surface of the water.[^1]

### The Sighting

The GoFast video was recorded during the same series of encounters as the [[GIMBAL Video]], which took place off the coast of the Southeastern United States. The video shows a small, round object that is being tracked by the aircraft's targeting pod. The pilots can be heard expressing their astonishment at the object's speed, with one exclaiming, "Whoa, got it! Whoo-hoooo! What the f--- is that thing?"[^1]

### Analysis and Significance

The GoFast video is significant because it appears to show a UAP exhibiting hypersonic velocity at a very low altitude, a feat that is not possible with any known conventional aircraft. While some analysts have suggested that the object's speed may be an illusion caused by a parallax effect, the pilots who witnessed the event were clearly impressed by its velocity.[^1]

The release of the GoFast video, along with the [[Tic Tac]] and [[GIMBAL Video|GIMBAL]] videos, was a crucial moment in the UAP disclosure movement. It provided another piece of credible evidence that the U.S. military was encountering objects with extraordinary capabilities, and it helped to fuel the public and congressional demand for greater transparency on the UAP issue.[^1]
