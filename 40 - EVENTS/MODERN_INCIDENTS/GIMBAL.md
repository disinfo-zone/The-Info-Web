The [[GIMBAL]] is one of the three declassified [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]] videos released by the [[Pentagon]] in 2017. The video, which was captured by the crew of an F/A-18 Super Hornet from the [[USS Roosevelt]] Carrier Strike Group in 2015, shows a UAP exhibiting flight characteristics that are not possible with any known aircraft.[^1]

### The Sighting

The GIMBAL video was recorded during a series of encounters between the [[USS Roosevelt]] Carrier Strike Group and multiple UAP off the coast of the Southeastern United States. In the video, the pilots track a single object from a fleet of five. The object is described as a white, elongated shape, but when the camera mode is switched, it appears as a black, lenticular, or "flying saucer" shape with a bulge on its top and bottom.[^1]

The most remarkable aspect of the video is the object's ability to rotate in mid-air against a 120-knot headwind without losing altitude. The object slows, parks itself in the air, and then rotates, or "gimbals," in a way that defies the known laws of aerodynamics. The pilots can be heard expressing their astonishment and disbelief at the object's performance.[^1]

### Analysis and Significance

The GIMBAL video is significant because it provides clear, high-fidelity evidence of a UAP exhibiting several of [[The Five Observables]], including low observability (no heat signature), antigravity (hovering against a strong headwind), and instantaneous acceleration. The object's ability to rotate without any apparent means of propulsion or control surfaces is a key piece of evidence that it is not a conventional aircraft.[^1]

The release of the GIMBAL video, along with the [[Tic Tac]] and [[GoFast]] videos, was a watershed moment in the UAP disclosure movement. It provided the public and Congress with undeniable evidence that the U.S. military was encountering objects with capabilities far beyond our own, and it helped to legitimize the UAP issue as a serious national security concern.[^1]
