Iranian Revolution refers to the popular uprising in [[Iran]] that led to the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in February 1979. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] had provided upbeat predictions that the Shah would manage to cling to power, despite a trenchant analysis from [[Uri Lubrani]], a former Israeli ambassador to Iran, in 1978, which stated that the Shah would not survive. The CIA's embarrassingly inept reporting on Iran forced the American leadership to turn once again to Israeli help in trying to anticipate world events.[^1]
