The Bandung Conference was a meeting of Asian and African states, most of which were newly independent, held in Bandung, Indonesia, in April 1955. Egyptian leader [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] attended this conference and received a promise from [[Chou En-lai]], the Chinese premier, for as many arms as [[Egypt]] could afford. This marked a significant step in Nasser's efforts to secure military aid from the Communist world.[^1]
