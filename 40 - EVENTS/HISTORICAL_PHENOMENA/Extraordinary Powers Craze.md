The [[Extraordinary Powers Craze]] was a period of intense interest in paranormal phenomena in [[China]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was sparked by a 1979 newspaper article about a twelve-year-old boy named Tang Yu who could allegedly read with his ears.[^1]

This event led to a nationwide fascination with [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF), with numerous reports of children and adults demonstrating psychic abilities such as [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]]. The Chinese government, influenced by the scientist [[Qian Xuesen]], officially sanctioned research into these phenomena, leading to the establishment of research institutes and a surge in the practice of [[qigong]].[^1]
