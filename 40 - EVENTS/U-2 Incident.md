The [[U-2 Spy Plane|U-2]] Incident refers to the shooting down of an American U-2 spy plane over the [[Soviet Union]] on May 1, 1960. The incident, involving pilot [[Gary Francis Powers]], caused a major international crisis and led to the ruin of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s Paris summit meeting scheduled for a few weeks later. It also prompted Eisenhower to order an end to all reconnaissance flights over [[Russia]].[^1]
