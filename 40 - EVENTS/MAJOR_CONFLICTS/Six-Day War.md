The Six-Day War was a conflict fought between [[Israel]] and a coalition of Arab states (primarily [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and [[Jordan]]) from June 5 to June 10, 1967. [[Israel]] launched a preemptive strike against the increasing Arab buildup in the [[Sinai]] and achieved a stunning victory, humiliating the Soviet-supplied Arabs and seizing [[Egypt]]'s [[Sinai Peninsula]], the [[Gaza Strip]], [[Jordan]]'s [[West Bank]], and [[Syria]]'s [[Golan Heights]]. The war also resulted in the Old City of [[Jerusalem]] coming under Jewish control.[^1]

Following the war, [[Charles de Gaulle]] responded by accusing [[Israel]] of being the aggressor and canceling all of [[France]]'s arms sales to [[Israel]], abrogating twelve years of close French support. He also delayed the pending shipment of fifty previously purchased Mirage III jet fighters.[^1]
