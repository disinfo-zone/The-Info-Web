The Arab-Israeli War (1948-1949) refers to the conflict that began after the end of the British Mandate for Palestine and the declaration of the State of [[Israel]] in May 1948. This war resulted in [[Israel]]'s victory and the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]]. The [[United Nations]] approved Resolution 194 after the war, directing that the refugees had to be given the option of returning to [[Israel]] if they wished to do so.[^1]
