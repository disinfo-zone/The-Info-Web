[[Syria]] is a country in the Middle East that has been significantly involved in the regional drug trade and political conflicts. Its president, [[Hafez al-Assad]], played a role in regional politics and alliances.[^1]

### Drug Trade and Political Influence

[[Syria]] maintained control of the Bekaa Valley in [[Lebanon]], a major heroin-producing area, after the Lebanese civil war. Syrian occupation forces reportedly profited from and protected the drug trade, with estimates suggesting up to $2 billion in protection money was paid annually by dope plantation operators. The Bekaa also became a center for processing Colombian cartel cocaine for re-export to European markets. In 1988, two Syrians arrested with large quantities of heroin and coke in Milan, [[Italy]], claimed to be working for a Syrian colonel in Bekaa.[^1]

There were long-standing back-channel relations between Washington D.C. and Damascus. A 1987 [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] memo indicated that [[Oliver North]] was personally notified that Syrian intelligence in [[Lebanon]] was willing to negotiate with the [[White House]] for the release of hostages held by Lebanese terrorists. President [[George Bush]] himself reportedly made secret visits to Damascus for hostage negotiations.[^1]

After Desert Storm, [[Hafez al-Assad]] closed ranks with the [[White House]] and softened his stance against [[Israel]]. President [[George Bush]] and Secretary of State [[James Baker]] encouraged [[Syria]] and [[Israel]] to recognize each other's Lebanese occupation zones. Under a 1990 accord, [[Syria]] maintained control of the Bekaa Valley, including notorious drug ports north of Beirut.[^1]

### Connections to Pan Am Flight 103

[[Syria]] was implicated in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The private investigative firm [[Interfor]] claimed that the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command|PFLP-GC]] was behind the bombing and that the flight was part of a heroin smuggling route connected to the Syrian regime and protected by both the [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration|U.S. DEA]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. [[Monzer Al-Kassar]], a Syrian kingpin and arms dealer, was alleged to oversee this ring. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] was reportedly protecting Al-Kassar's operation due to his cooperation in freeing U.S. hostages in [[Lebanon]].[^1]

Allegations suggested that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] instructed [[Germany]]'s internal intelligence agency, the [[BKA]], to allow certain suitcases to pass uninspected onto U.S.-bound flights at the Frankfurt airport. A suitcase intended for heroin was covertly substituted with explosives by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command|PFLP-GC]] and [[Monzer Al-Kassar]]. In 1990, when the [[White House]] sought [[Syria]] as a partner in the Allied coalition, blame for the Pan Am bombing shifted from [[Syria]] to [[Libya]].[^1]

### Other Connections

[[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s affidavit stated that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] was using [[Euramae Trading Company]] to sell [[PROMIS]] software to drug abuse control agencies in various Middle Eastern countries, including [[Syria]].[^1]
