[[Guatemala]] is a country in Central [[America]]. It is mentioned in connection with political instability, military coups, and U.S. involvement in the region.[^1]

[[General Ríos Montt]] became president of [[Guatemala]] in an army coup in March 1982. He was supported by the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration and aided by Full Gospel businessman [[John Carrette]]. Montt's military regime (1982–1983) was involved in severe atrocities during [[Guatemala]]'s 36-year civil war. Despite this, the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration continued its support, with [[Ronald Reagan]] praising Montt's integrity and commitment. In January 1983, Reagan agreed to sell [[Guatemala]] millions of dollars worth of helicopter spare parts without Congressional approval.[^1]

Montt's extreme Christian fundamentalism eventually led to his ousting in another coup in August 1983 by General [[Oscar Mejia Victores]]. However, [[Ronald Reagan]] later pressured Congress to approve $300,000 in military training for the Guatemalan army.[^1]

[[Jimmy Hughes]]' mother was a Christian missionary in [[Guatemala]]. Hughes also moved to [[Guatemala]] after leaving [[Los Angeles]] and before joining FGBMFI in [[Honduras]].[^1]
