[[Afghanistan]] is a country in Central [[Asia]] that was the site of a significant conflict involving the Soviet Union and the [[Mujahideen]]. It is also mentioned as one of the countries whose economies are dependent on the drug trade.[^1]

### Soviet-Afghan War and Mujahideen Support

[[Afghanistan]] was the focus of a worldwide support network for the [[Mujahideen]], the Afghanistan Resistance Movement against the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. This network involved figures like [[Ralph Olberg]] and [[Tim Osman]], who were instrumental in procuring [[United States|U.S.]] weapons and technology for the Mujahideen. Discussions included the Mujahideen's willingness to field test new and esoteric weapons and provide research reports with photos. The exchange of arms for drugs, with cocaine or heroin being used as payment for weapons.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] was involved in discussions about analyzing a Soviet-directed weapons system called "Blue Death," captured by the Afghan rebels, to help develop effective countermeasures. Plans also included a military joint venture in [[Turkey]] to produce specialized ammunition and a lobbying effort to legally obtain Stinger II missiles and their variants for the Mujahideen. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] was tasked with formulating a plan to sanitize the electronics of any Stingers at risk of Soviet capture.[^1]

[[Ralph Olberg]]'s arms assistance project to the Afghan rebels was understood to be legally sanctioned, operating through the State Department and Senator Humphrey's office. However, there was a "turf battle problem" with certain factions of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and their group, MSH ([[Management Science For Health]]), who questioned whether Olberg and Osman's group truly represented the leadership of the Afghan rebel resistance.[^1]
