The [[Philippines]] is an archipelago nation in Southeast [[Asia]]. It is mentioned in the context of [[Ignacio Paz]], the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence in the Philippine government, who was assisted by [[Robert Booth Nichols]] in removing large sums of money from the [[Philippines]] by investing with Nichols, who placed the money in Swiss bank accounts.[^1]

[[Art Suchesk]], a friend of [[Allan Boyak]] and a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] proprietary company runner, repeatedly encountered [[Robert Booth Nichols]] in the [[Philippines]], among other locations, after the Los Angeles [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] dropped its interest in Nichols.[^1]
