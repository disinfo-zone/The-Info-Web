The [[Panama Canal]] is a vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In 1977, the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration was determined to sign a treaty regarding the Panama Canal with [[General Torrijos]]. This determination reportedly influenced the administration's reluctance to pursue Torrijos, despite his and his family members' alleged involvement at the highest levels of the world cocaine trade.[^1]
