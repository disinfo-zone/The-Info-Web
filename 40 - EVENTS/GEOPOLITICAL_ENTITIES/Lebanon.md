[[Lebanon]] is a country in the Middle East that has been a focal point for various international political, military, and illicit activities, particularly during the 1980s. Its strategic location and internal conflicts made it a significant area for intelligence operations, arms dealing, and drug trafficking.[^1]

### Political and Military Landscape

In 1982, [[Israel]] invaded [[Lebanon]] with the aim of crushing [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] strongholds and installing the Gamayel family in power. At this time, Tel-Aviv supported the ultra-right Christian Phalange militia. The Christian Phalangist militia was instrumental in introducing [[Lebanon]] into the heroin trade. The powerful Christian Gamayel family sought external support for money, weapons, and political backing, with the international heroin trafficking network being a primary source.[^1]

Following the Israeli invasion, the Lebanese Parliament elected [[Bashir Gemayel]] to the presidency, who was reportedly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] payroll. However, Bashir was assassinated before taking office, and his brother, [[Amin Gamayel]], was subsequently installed as president.[^1]

In 1990, an accord was reached that granted Christians and Muslims equal representation, officially ending the civil war. Under this accord, [[Syria]] maintained control of the Bekaa Valley, including notorious drug ports north of Beirut.[^1]

### Drug Trafficking and Intelligence Operations

[[Lebanon]] became a significant hub for drug trafficking, particularly heroin. The Bekaa Valley saw an explosion in heroin production under Syrian occupation, with Syrian forces reportedly profiting from and protecting the trade. Estimates suggested that up to $2 billion in protection money was paid annually by dope plantation operators to Syrian occupation forces. The Bekaa also served as a center for processing Colombian cartel cocaine for re-export to European markets.[^1]

Various intelligence agencies and organizations were involved in [[Lebanon]]'s drug trade:

*   **[[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]]:** This company, reportedly a [[National Security Council|NSC]] cutout, was involved in [[Lebanon]] to arrange the release of a prisoner and discussed a multi-billion dollar financial transaction for the country's reconstruction. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] had a companion company, Euramae Trading, which operated throughout the Middle East and was involved in the drug trade as an [[National Security Council|NSC]]-directed operation.[^1]
*   **[[Euramae Trading Company]]:** Described as a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]/[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] "front" in Nicosia, [[Cyprus]], Euramae was a transit point for heroin, cash, documents, and bootleg computer software moving along the Beirut-Nicosia-U.S. pipeline. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed to have handled communications protocol and financial transactions for operations in [[Lebanon]], including those involving [[Maurice Ghanem]] and [[George K. Pender]].[^1]
*   **U.S. Government Presence:** The [[United States Government|U.S. government]]'s presence in [[Lebanon]] was significant. [[Lester Coleman]], a [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] covert intelligence officer, ran a network of agents in Beirut to find American hostages. He claimed that the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], along with Cypriot, German, and British police, ran a "drug sting operation" code-named "Khourah" that involved delivering heroin from the Bekaa Valley to the [[United States]]. This operation allegedly used Pan Am Flight 103 as a "controlled delivery" flight, which later tragically exploded over Scotland.[^1]
*   **Syrian Involvement:** [[Syria]]'s president [[Hafez al-Assad]] closed ranks with the [[White House]] after Desert Storm, and [[Syria]] maintained control of the Bekaa Valley, including drug ports. Allegations surfaced that [[Monzer Al-Kassar]], a Syrian kingpin and arms dealer, provided [[Oliver North]] with drug profits to purchase arms for the [[Contras]].[^1]

### Key Individuals and Events

*   **[[Amin Gamayel]]:** President of [[Lebanon]] who received a letter from [[George K. Pender]] of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] regarding reconstruction efforts.[^1]
*   **[[Maurice Ghanem]]:** A figure involved in meetings concerning [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]]'s participation in the redevelopment of [[Lebanon]], and under whom [[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed to have worked.[^1]
*   **[[Michael T. Hurley]]:** [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] Country Attache in Nicosia, [[Cyprus]], who had overall responsibility for Euramae Trading Company and its initiative to sell [[PROMIS]] software to Middle Eastern countries.[^1]
*   **[[Werner Tony Asmar]]:** A German Lebanese intelligence agent who worked with [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] and was killed in a bomb explosion in Beirut after getting involved in the alleged drug operation.[^1]
*   **[[Ian Stuart Spiro]]:** Lived in Beirut during the 1970s and 1980s, making contacts with Lebanese religious leaders and the Islamic Jihad. His death was linked to a spy network and the [[Iran-Contra Affair]].[^1]
