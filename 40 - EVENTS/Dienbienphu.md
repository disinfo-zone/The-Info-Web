Dienbienphu was a decisive battle in the First Indochina War, fought between the French Union's colonial forces and the Viet Minh (led by [[Ho Chi Minh]]) in 1954. The disastrous defeat of [[France]] at Dienbienphu contributed to a change in attitude among many French military men who had been skeptical of an independent nuclear deterrent. This defeat, coupled with the subsequent collapse of French colonialism in North Africa, made it clear that [[France]] could not depend on its [[NATO]] allies to protect purely French interests.[^1]
