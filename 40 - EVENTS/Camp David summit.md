Camp David summit was a series of meetings between Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] and Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], facilitated by U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], in September 1978. The summit led to the [[Camp David Accords]], which were seen as a significant step towards peace in the [[Middle East]]. Some American intelligence officials suspected that Carter's decision to provide [[Israel]] with KH-11 satellite photographs was a reward for Begin's success at this summit.[^1]
