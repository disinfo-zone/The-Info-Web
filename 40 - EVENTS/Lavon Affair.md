The Lavon Affair was a covert Israeli operation in [[Egypt]] in mid-1954, involving an Israeli spy ring that bombed and sabotaged American, British, and Egyptian targets. The goal of these bombings was to derail pending British and American negotiations and possible rapprochement with the [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] government, aiming to keep [[Egypt]] isolated from Western powers.[^1]

An internal Israeli investigation was unable to determine who had given the order for the sabotage activities. [[Moshe Sharett]], who had not known of the operation, accepted [[Pinhas Lavon]]'s resignation in January 1955. The affair resurfaced as a major scandal in the early 1960s, with new revelations suggesting that low-level officials in the defense ministry might have falsified documents and given misleading testimony to accuse Lavon of authorizing the operation. Lavon, then head of the [[Histadrut]], publicly charged that [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Moshe Dayan]] had undermined civilian authority over the military, leaking his allegations to the press and breaking cardinal rules of Israeli politics.[^1]
