The [[Lockheed bribe scandal]] refers to a series of bribery incidents involving the [[Lockheed Aircraft Company]]. In [[Israel]], a specific instance of this scandal came to light in 1976 through an intercepted telegram.[^1]

[[Ari Ben-Menashe]], while serving as a duty officer in [[Unit 8200]], intercepted a telegram from the [[Iran|Iranian]] Embassy in [[Ramat Gan]] to [[Tehran]]. This telegram detailed a meeting between an [[Lockheed Aircraft Company|Lockheed]] representative in [[Israel]] and [[Shimon Peres]], then Defense Minister, revealing a bribe of $3.5 million deposited into one of [[Shimon Peres|Peres's]] brother's business accounts in [[Europe]].[^1]

Despite the explosive nature of this information, it was covered up by [[Israel|Israeli]] military intelligence superiors, including [[Yoel Ben-Porat|Col. Yoel Ben-Porat]] and [[Sasson Yishaek|Lt. Col. Sasson Yishaek]]. The original telegram, its translation, and related logs were ordered to be erased, and the young woman working with [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] was transferred to another unit. No public disclosure or inquiry was ever made regarding [[Israel|Israel's]] involvement in the scandal.[^1]
