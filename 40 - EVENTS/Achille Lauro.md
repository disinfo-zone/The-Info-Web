The [[Achille Lauro]] was a cruise ship that was attacked in 1985. This event is described as an [[Israel|Israeli]] "black" propaganda operation designed to portray Palestinians as deadly and cutthroat.[^1]

The operation was orchestrated by [[Rafi Eitan]], who passed instructions to [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah]]. [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] then relayed orders to [[Abul Abbas]], who was reportedly receiving millions from [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence officers posing as Sicilian dons. [[Abul Abbas|Abbas]] gathered a team to attack the cruise ship, with instructions to make the attack severe to show the world what would happen if Palestinian demands were not met.[^1]

During the attack, an elderly [[USA|American]] Jewish man in a wheelchair was killed and his body thrown overboard. For [[Israel]], this was considered the best kind of anti-Palestinian propaganda.[^1]
