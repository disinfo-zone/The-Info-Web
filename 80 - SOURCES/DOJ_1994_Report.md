# DOJ Report on Bua's Report (1994)

U.S. Department of Justice. *Report of the United States Department of Justice On the Review of Special Counsel Nicholas J. Bua's Report on the Allegations of INSLAW, Inc.* September 27, 1994. (Hereafter, "DOJ 1994 Report")

This report summarizes the analysis and investigation undertaken by the Department of Justice following Attorney General Janet Reno's mandate to review Special Counsel Nicholas J. Bua's report and Inslaw's analysis of that report. It primarily reflects the independent conclusions reached after a detailed review of Bua's investigation and report, as well as documentation and testimony accumulated in several other investigations. The report also includes findings from new investigations into allegations raised by Inslaw after Bua's report was completed.

The report recommends that the Attorney General adopt Bua's conclusions in their entirety, which include findings that there is no credible evidence of a conspiracy to steal PROMIS or injure Inslaw, no evidence of fraud or deceit in obtaining PROMIS, no improper influence in Judge Bason's reappointment, no improper conversion of Inslaw's bankruptcy case, and no destruction of documents. It also concludes that J. Daniel Casolaro's death was a suicide and recommends against appointing an independent prosecutor or authorizing additional compensation to Inslaw.
