*[[The Secret Life of Plants]]* is a 1973 book by [[Peter Tompkins]] and [[Christopher O. Bird]] that explores the concept of plant sentience and their alleged psychic abilities. The book popularized the controversial experiments of [[Cleve Backster]], who claimed that plants exhibit a form of consciousness and can respond to human thoughts and emotions.[^1]

While the book was a bestseller and sparked widespread interest in plant consciousness, it was heavily criticized by mainstream scientists for its lack of scientific rigor and its reliance on anecdotal evidence. Despite the criticism, the book contributed to the broader cultural fascination with [[Parapsychology]] and the potential for unconventional forms of perception.[^1]
