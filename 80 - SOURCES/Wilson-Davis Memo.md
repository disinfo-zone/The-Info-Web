The [[Wilson-Davis Memo]], also known as the "Wilson/Davis document," is a 13-page document that purports to be a summary of a 2002 conversation between astrophysicist [[Eric Davis]] and Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson, who was then the Director of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA). The memo details Admiral Wilson's alleged discovery of and subsequent denial of access to a deeply hidden U.S. government program that was reverse-engineering technology recovered from crashed [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP).[^1]

### The Memo's Content

According to the memo, Admiral Wilson, after discovering references to a UAP reverse-engineering program in budget line items, attempted to gain access to it. He was met with resistance from the program's corporate contractor, whose attorney informed him that he did not have a "need to know" and that further inquiries could result in the loss of his career and pension. The program was described as being focused on retrieving and analyzing advanced vehicles of non-human origin, and it was operating with a level of secrecy that superseded even the authority of the Director of the DIA.[^1]

### Origins and Leak

The memo was written by [[Eric Davis]] as a summary of his conversation with Admiral Wilson. It was shared confidentially with a small group of colleagues, including [[Hal Puthoff]]. A copy was given to astronaut [[Dr. Edgar Mitchell]], a longtime advocate for UAP transparency. After Dr. Mitchell's death, the memo was discovered in his files and was leaked to the public. The document was later entered into the Congressional Record during a public hearing on UAP in May 2022.[^1]

### Significance

The Wilson/Davis Memo is considered a key piece of evidence by many in the UAP disclosure movement. It provides a detailed, firsthand account of the existence of a "Legacy Program" within the military-industrial complex that controls access to recovered UAP technology. The memo highlights the extreme level of secrecy surrounding this issue and the power of private contractors to operate outside of normal government oversight. The allegations in the memo, if true, represent a profound failure of transparency and accountability within the U.S. government.[^1]
