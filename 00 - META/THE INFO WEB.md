Welcome to The Info Web, a living, growing research garden where the threads of esoteric phenomena, hidden government activities, and the unexplained converge. This is an open peek at a private wiki run by [disinfo.zone](https://disinfo.zone), a network graph of developing connections, and a meticulously documented record of events, laid bare for future scrutiny.

**Are you ready to dive down the rabbit hole?**

Our effort is to illuminate hidden connections and illegal activities, building an interconnected web of knowledge to better understand the forces shaping our world. We invite you to explore the depths of this vault.

**Where to begin your journey:**

- [[KEY INDIVIDUALS]] - Discover the pioneers, psychics, and power players who shaped these hidden histories.
- [[KEY ORGANIZATIONS]] - Uncover the government agencies, private entities, and shadowy groups involved in the pursuit of the unknown.
- [[KEY PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS]] - Delve into the secret initiatives, from psychic spying to mind control, that pushed the boundaries of human understanding.
- [[KEY EVENTS]] - Witness the pivotal moments, from Cold War experiments to modern incidents, that reveal the unfolding narrative.
- [[KEY CONCEPTS AND TECH]] - Grasp the scientific theories, esoteric ideas, and advanced technologies that underpin these extraordinary claims.

For those with a more open perspective of our world and our place within it, try exploring [[THE PHENOMENON]] or [[STARGATE PROJECT]]. For the conspiracy-minded, you may find your starting point with [[SOFTWARE_PROJECTS/PROMIS|PROMIS]].

Or you can always check the [[CHANGELOG]] to see where research is happening.
