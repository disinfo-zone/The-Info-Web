[[Israel]]'s nuclear program developed in secret, a fact often deliberately ignored by [[United States]] leadership since the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. This account, based on [[Seymour Hersh]]'s *The Samson Option*, details the agreements, individuals, and events that created [[Israel]]'s nuclear arsenal and its "Samson Option" doctrine.

## The Scientist

The scientific director of [[Israel]]'s bomb project was [[Ernst David Bergmann]], an organic chemist who fled [[Nazi Germany]]. As chairman of [[Israel]]'s [[Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), established in 1952, Bergmann publicly advocated for peaceful nuclear research while covertly leading the weapons program. He worked directly with Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and his protégé, [[Shimon Peres]], then director general of the [[Ministry of Defense]]. Their goal was an ultimate deterrent for [[Israel]]. To maintain secrecy, the project was financed largely through private contributions from American and European Jews, bypassing standard government appropriations.

Early research at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], where Bergmann directed the chemistry division, developed methods for heavy water production and uranium extraction from the phosphate deposits of the [[Negev Desert]]. In November 1954, Bergmann publicly announced the AEC's establishment and its progress in peaceful research. [[Israel]] signed an "Atoms for Peace" agreement with the [[United States]] under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], which provided a small research reactor at [[Nahal Soreq]] subject to American inspections. [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s primary objective, however, remained an independent nuclear capability, driven by the fear of a "second [[Holocaust]]" initiated by Arab states, particularly [[Egypt]] under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]. Bergmann's dual roles as scientific adviser and director of research for the defense ministry ensured that all scientific work served this strategic imperative. His early work for the [[Hagannah]] during the British Mandate and his connections to scientists like [[Herman F. Mark]] and [[Frederick A. Lindemann]] (Winston Churchill's science adviser) laid the project's foundation. As early as 1947, he told financier [[Abraham Feinberg]], "There's uranium in the desert."

## The French Connection

[[France]], seeking its own nuclear deterrent and mired in the Algerian War, became [[Israel]]'s essential partner in the nuclear program. [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Ernst David Bergmann]] leveraged Israeli intelligence on the [[Middle East]] and support for French actions in [[Algeria]] to secure a deal for a large nuclear reactor and a chemical reprocessing plant.

The [[Suez Crisis]] solidified the French-Israeli bond. After [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s intervention, which [[Israel]] viewed as a betrayal, French Prime Minister Guy Mollet privately declared of the Israelis, "I owe the bomb to them." This commitment, though never publicized, advanced [[France]]'s own nuclear program and gave [[Israel]] the blueprint for its "[[Force de Frappe]]."

Construction of the [[Dimona]] reactor, first designated EL 102, began in early 1958. Thousands of French engineers and technicians, alongside North African Jewish laborers, established a large, classified construction site in the [[Negev Desert]]. The project faced internal Israeli opposition due to its high cost and moral implications, but [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s support was absolute. French firms, notably [[Saint-Gobain Techniques Nouvelles]] (SGN), were instrumental in constructing the underground reprocessing facility needed to extract weapons-grade plutonium. Financing was handled discreetly, relying on fundraising from Jewish philanthropists to avoid official oversight and international scrutiny.

## First Knowledge

[[United States]] intelligence detected the construction at [[Dimona]]. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Photographic Intelligence Division, led by [[Arthur C. Lundahl]] and [[Dino A. Brugioni]], began monitoring the site with [[U-2 Spy Plane|U-2]] overflights in the late 1950s. Initially misidentified as an ammunition-testing range, the scale of the excavation and concrete work soon revealed the signature of a nuclear facility. Brugioni noted the construction was "thick and deep" with "huge or distinctive chimneys," consistent with a nuclear plant.

President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and his senior advisors were informed about [[Dimona]] but adopted a policy of deliberate ambiguity. This practice of "looking the other way" continued under subsequent administrations. Aware of the U-2 surveillance, the Israelis employed countermeasures, including using covered trucks for debris removal and planting trees to obscure the site, creating an "Alphonse and Gaston act." The architectural resemblance between [[Dimona]] and [[France]]'s [[Marcoule]] nuclear facility confirmed for American intelligence that [[Israel]] was building a chemical reprocessing plant for producing weapons-grade plutonium. Despite the evidence, the [[United States]] officially remained unable to confirm the reprocessing plant's existence, a result of a deliberate policy of self-censorship within the U.S. government regarding [[Israel]]'s nuclear activities.

## Internal Wars

[[Israel]]'s nuclear project faced significant internal opposition. The high cost and diversion of scientific and technical manpower from other sectors sparked fierce debate. Many government officials prioritized conventional military forces, viewing a doomsday weapon as an economic folly for a developing nation. Tensions at the [[Dimona]] site were high, fueled by the perceived arrogance of French engineers and instances of anti-Semitic behavior towards Israeli and North African Jewish laborers. The site's internal "caste system" included hiring North African Jews for 59-day contracts to avoid paying benefits.

Despite these challenges, [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Ernst David Bergmann]] forced the project forward. To maintain security, Peres established the Office of Special Tasks, later known by its Hebrew acronym [[LAKAM]]. Its director, [[Binyamin Blumberg]], managed security and recruitment, bypassing bureaucratic obstacles to hire essential scientists. By early 1960, Israeli nuclear physicists and technicians, many trained in [[France]], returned to staff the facility, receiving double pay and subsidized housing in Beersheba. The Israeli government maintained various cover stories for [[Dimona]], claiming it was a seawater desalinization plant or an agricultural research station. Foreign diplomats like Ian Smart accepted these explanations without challenge, allowing the clandestine work to proceed.

## Going Public

The secrecy around [[Dimona]] was broken in December 1960 by a leak to the New York Times. Washington correspondent [[John W. Finney]] received the tip from [[John A. McCone]], then chairman of the [[United States]] [[Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC). McCone, reportedly "mad, sputtering mad" over Israeli deception ("They told us it was a textile plant"), intended to expose the French-built reactor. The orchestrated leak allowed the outgoing [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration to pressure [[Israel]] for an official acknowledgment without direct confrontation.

In response, [[David Ben-Gurion]] addressed the Knesset on December 21, stating that the [[Dimona]] reactor was "dedicated entirely to peaceful purposes" and would be open to international scholars upon completion. This statement, a deliberate falsehood crafted by [[Shimon Peres]] and his aides, became [[Israel]]'s official public position. Although [[Ernst David Bergmann]]'s connection to a weapons program was widely known, the [[United States]] government formally accepted [[Israel]]'s assurances. A private State Department circular instructed American embassies to "still the atmosphere," institutionalizing the policy of ambiguity.

## The Ambassador

From 1961 to 1973, [[Walworth Barbour]], the American ambassador to [[Israel]], executed the [[United States]]' policy of deliberate ignorance. A reclusive diplomat, Barbour received accurate intelligence from his embassy on [[Dimona]]'s progress but ensured this information did not trigger decisive action in Washington. He explained his mission to subordinates as keeping "the Jews off the President's back" by maintaining a stable relationship, even at the cost of strategic clarity.

The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s attempts to confirm the existence of [[Dimona]]'s underground reprocessing plant, including through the recruitment of American Jews in [[Israel]], were consistently obstructed. [[Israel]]'s security measures and the overarching U.S. political reluctance to force the issue meant that the full scope of the program remained officially unconfirmed. Barbour's adherence to this policy, including suppressing his own embassy's reports on Israeli warhead development, was central to enabling [[Israel]]'s nuclear secrecy. He rarely met with journalists, operating discreetly to ensure that "no bad news" reached the President.

## Dual Loyalty

[[Israel]]'s clandestine nuclear program created a "dual loyalty" dilemma for American Jews in sensitive government roles. [[Lewis Strauss]], former chairman of the [[Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), publicly opposed nuclear proliferation while privately supporting [[Israel]]'s nuclear ambitions, a position rooted in his personal experiences with the [[Holocaust]]. Strauss, who insisted his name be pronounced "Straws" to sound assimilated, later used his influence to arrange a fellowship at Princeton for [[Ernst David Bergmann]] after Bergmann's forced resignation from the Israeli AEC.

Concerns about dual loyalty led to discriminatory practices within U.S. intelligence. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[NSA]] barred Jewish personnel from Hebrew language training or assignments related to [[Israel]], fearing "Israeli penetration of America." Despite evidence of financial and technical support for [[Dimona]] from American and European Jews, the [[United States]] government maintained a policy of deliberate ignorance. This self-censorship prevented rigorous scrutiny of the program. The case of [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro|Zalman Shapiro]], a nuclear fuel processor later investigated for the suspected diversion of enriched uranium to [[Israel]], intensified these concerns.

## A Presidential Struggle

The [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration engaged in an intense but ultimately futile struggle with [[Israel]] over its nuclear program. President Kennedy, a committed nonproliferation advocate, was opposed by [[David Ben-Gurion]], who was determined to build a nuclear deterrent. [[Abraham Feinberg]], a major Democratic Party fund-raiser, used his political influence to obstruct American inspection efforts at [[Dimona]]. Feinberg advocated for [[Israel]]'s weapons program in direct appeals to senior officials like [[Robert S. McNamara]] and [[Paul H. Nitze]].

Despite Kennedy's pressure, including formal letters to [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]] and the dispatch of an inspection team led by nuclear reprocessing expert [[Floyd L. Culler, Jr.]], [[Israel]] successfully obstructed meaningful oversight. The Israelis constructed a "Potemkin Village" at [[Dimona]], with a false control room and staged language barriers, to mislead inspectors. Israeli technicians feigned ignorance of Hebrew to avoid answering questions. The American teams were denied full access to critical areas, such as the reactor core, "for safety reasons." This deception allowed [[Israel]]'s program to proceed. Kennedy's appointment of the staunch anti-proliferator [[John A. McCone]] as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director was a counter-move, but McCone's efforts to gather intelligence on [[Dimona]] also failed.

## Years of Pressure

Throughout 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] pressed [[David Ben-Gurion]] for nuclear inspections, but was met only with assurances of peaceful intent. Kennedy privately fumed about the "sons of bitches" who "lie to me constantly about their nuclear capability." He made political moves to undermine [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]], including a private meeting with Foreign Minister [[Golda Meir]], a critic of [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s unilateral approach. In this meeting, Kennedy made an unprecedented private commitment that the [[United States]] would come to [[Israel]]'s aid in the event of an invasion, a guarantee not offered by [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].

[[Israel]]'s nuclear program advanced regardless. The [[Dimona]] reactor, which went critical in 1962, operated at over seventy megawatts—far exceeding the publicly stated twenty-four megawatts—thereby increasing its plutonium yield. Work on the chemical reprocessing plant resumed with the help of private French contractors, despite public disavowals from [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Development of the [[Jericho I]] missile, designed for a miniaturized nuclear warhead, also proceeded. [[David Ben-Gurion|Ben-Gurion]]'s unyielding position on [[Dimona]], combined with public scandals like the [[Lavon Affair]] and the controversy over West German scientists aiding [[Egypt]]'s missile program, contributed to his resignation in 1963. His successor, [[Levi Eshkol]], was more pragmatic but still faced the challenge of balancing the nuclear program with the country's conventional military needs.

## Playing the Game

By the mid-1960s, the [[United States]] government established a fixed policy regarding [[Israel]]'s nuclear program. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and his advisors maintained a public stance of nonproliferation while privately accommodating [[Israel]]'s nuclear development. Intelligence analysts understood that detailed reports on [[Israel]]'s capabilities were politically unwelcome.

Despite intelligence on [[Israel]]'s [[Jericho I]] missile program, including [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-developed scale models and warhead designs, official acknowledgment was suppressed. A CIA technical analyst recalled designing notional nuclear, chemical, and high-explosive warheads for the Jericho "as a game" to project [[Israel]]'s capabilities; his official reports were never published. Even [[James Jesus Angleton]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s head of counterintelligence with close ties to [[Israel]], met resistance when he tried to formalize assessments of [[Israel]]'s nuclear status. His reports, though supported by [[U-2 Spy Plane|U-2]] imagery, were often questioned by analysts who deemed his human intelligence sources unreliable. This systemic denial, driven by political expediency, produced official intelligence estimates that consistently understated the scale and sophistication of [[Israel]]'s nuclear arsenal.

## The Samson Option

The "Samson Option" is [[Israel]]'s strategic and psychological doctrine of last-resort nuclear retaliation. Based on the biblical tale of Samson, the doctrine establishes [[Israel]]'s willingness to use its nuclear arsenal if its existence is threatened, ensuring mutual destruction for its enemies. This became the foundation of [[Israel]]'s nuclear deterrent.

By the mid-1960s, [[Dimona]] was producing weapons-grade plutonium. Israeli sources indicate that at least one low-yield or "zero yield" nuclear test was conducted in the [[Negev Desert]] during this time to validate the weapon assembly system. To deceive inspectors, elite Israeli military units camouflaged underground facilities with fresh sod before American visits. The administration of [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] largely ignored these developments. This tacit acceptance, influenced by Cold War geopolitics, allowed [[Dimona]]'s work to continue. The program's cost, over 10% of [[Israel]]'s military budget, caused internal debate, but proponents like [[Shimon Peres]] and [[Moshe Dayan]] prevailed.

## The Tunnel

At the core of [[Israel]]'s nuclear weapons production was "the Tunnel," a secret six-level underground chemical reprocessing plant at [[Dimona]] known as [[Machons (Dimona Facilities)|Machon]] 2. This facility, where [[Mordecai Vanunu]] later worked, was designed to extract weapons-grade plutonium from spent reactor fuel rods. Vanunu's disclosures in 1986, including photographs and detailed descriptions, provided the first hard evidence of [[Israel]]'s advanced nuclear capabilities, including its capacity to manufacture fusion (thermonuclear) weapons, such as low-yield neutron bombs.

The construction of the Tunnel required advanced engineering, including remote-controlled robotics for handling highly radioactive materials and precision machining of plutonium hemispheres for boosted-fission weapons. The program benefited from related scientific work, such as [[Aharon Katzir]]'s robotics research at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], which was partially funded by the U.S. Air Force. Vanunu's revelations confirmed not only a fully operational reprocessing plant but a program far more sophisticated than Western intelligence had estimated. He detailed the various "[[Machons (Dimona Facilities)|Machons]]" (buildings) at the complex and described a weekly production of plutonium "buttons," which indicated a reactor operating at approximately five times its officially declared output.

## Injustice

The suspected diversion of over two hundred pounds of enriched uranium from the NUMEC plant in [[Apollo, Pennsylvania]] by its owner, [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro|Zalman Shapiro]], remained a key, though unproven, element in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s assessment of [[Israel]]'s nuclear program. Intensive investigations by the FBI and congressional committees never produced definitive evidence linking Shapiro to a diversion. Suspicions were fueled by his strong Jewish identity and support for [[Israel]], which fit a "dual loyalty" stereotype held by some in the U.S. intelligence community.

Shapiro had performed legitimate, secret work for [[Israel]] on methods to protect its [[National Water Carrier]] from terrorist attacks, a project that was misconstrued during the investigation. The NUMEC case highlighted the challenges of nuclear material safeguards and the political biases that can affect intelligence assessments. Although much of the "material unaccounted for" (MUF) was later attributed to contamination within the plant's infrastructure—a common issue in nuclear processing—Shapiro's career was ruined.

## An Israeli Decision

Following the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], [[Israel]]'s nuclear program gained new momentum. In early December 1967, war hero [[Yigal Allon]] was given a private tour of a new nuclear missile field at Hirbat Zachariah in the Judean Mountains. The shelters, designed to house missiles imported disguised as pipeline sections, reportedly moved Allon to tears. This underscored [[Israel]]'s commitment to a credible deterrent, a need made urgent by [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s post-war arms embargo, which left [[Israel]] feeling isolated.

Defense Minister [[Moshe Dayan]] became a key proponent of the bomb, arguing that [[Israel]] could not depend on the [[United States]] to deter a Soviet attack. He advocated for mass-producing nuclear weapons targeted at the [[Soviet Union]], similar to [[France]]'s force de frappe strategy. His position was strengthened by intelligence suggesting Soviet nuclear targeting of Israeli cities and by [[Henry A. Kissinger|Henry Kissinger]]'s assessment that the U.S. would not intervene in a direct Soviet-Israeli conflict. Sometime in early 1968, without a formal cabinet vote, Dayan unilaterally ordered [[Dimona]] into full-scale production. This moment, reportedly celebrated by welding "NEVER AGAIN" onto the first warhead, marked [[Israel]]'s transition to a nuclear power. The acquisition of uranium ore for this phase involved covert operations like the "Plumbat Affair," in which [[Mossad]] agents arranged the secret acquisition of hundreds of tons of uranium from [[Belgium]].

## A Presidential Gift

After the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]] administration enabled [[Israel]]'s nuclear program by agreeing to sell advanced F-4 jet fighters to [[Israel]]. Influenced by [[Israel]]'s strategic importance in the [[Cold War]] and lobbying from figures like [[Abraham Feinberg]], Johnson approved the sale over the objections of the [[Pentagon]] and [[State Department]] and without requiring [[Israel]] to sign the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty]] (NPT). This was a tacit acceptance of [[Israel]]'s nuclear program.

By 1968, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] concluded that [[Israel]] possessed at least four nuclear warheads. This assessment was influenced by the analysis of [[Edward Teller]] and suspicions surrounding the alleged disappearance of enriched uranium from the NUMEC plant in [[Apollo, Pennsylvania]]. President Johnson, unwilling to deal with the political fallout of acknowledging [[Israel]]'s nuclear status, ordered this intelligence to be suppressed. This, combined with the F-4 sale, provided [[Israel]] with a delivery system for nuclear weapons. Johnson's decision, made after [[Richard Nixon]] had already won the 1968 election, was seen by some as a "farewell gift" and a repayment of Feinberg's loyalty.

## Prelude to War

By 1969, [[Israel]] was a de facto nuclear power, a reality accepted by the incoming administration of [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] and [[Henry A. Kissinger|Kissinger]]. Both men were skeptical of the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty|NPT]] and considered nuclear weapons a necessary component of [[Israel]]'s security. This policy shift was made clear by the termination of [[Floyd L. Culler, Jr.]]'s annual inspections of [[Dimona]], giving [[Israel]] an implicit license to continue its program without U.S. oversight.

The media largely adhered to the official policy of silence. A New York Times story in July 1970, based on a suppressed [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] estimate from [[Carl E. Duckett|Carl Duckett]], reported that the U.S. government had been operating on the assumption of an Israeli bomb for two years; the story received little public or congressional reaction. Despite concerns within the [[State Department]] and [[Pentagon]] about [[Israel]]'s acquisition of sensitive technologies like krytrons (electronic triggers for nuclear devices) and supercomputers (for nuclear simulations), the White House prioritized the strategic alliance. By 1973, [[Israel]]'s arsenal was estimated to include at least twenty warheads. Its delivery systems included missile launchers at Hirbat Zachariah and nuclear-capable F-4 fighters on 24-hour alert at Tel Nof air base. The acquisition of long-range artillery capable of firing miniaturized nuclear shells further diversified its options.

## Nuclear Blackmail

The [[Yom Kippur War]] in October 1973 created an existential crisis for [[Israel]]. Facing a devastating initial Arab offensive, [[Moshe Dayan]] and [[Golda Meir]]'s "kitchen cabinet" authorized the arming and targeting of [[Israel]]'s nuclear arsenal, activating the "Samson Option." This nuclear alert, involving operational missile launchers and specially marked F-4s, was intended to signal to the [[Soviet Union]] that [[Israel]] would not be defeated and to force the [[United States]] to begin an emergency airlift of conventional weapons.

[[Henry A. Kissinger|Henry Kissinger]], the newly appointed Secretary of State, was aware of the Israeli nuclear capability. His initial strategy to "let [[Israel]] come out ahead, but bleed" was abandoned in the face of nuclear escalation. In communications with Israeli Ambassador Simcha Dinitz, Kissinger received what he later termed "blackmail"—a clear indication that [[Israel]] was prepared to use nuclear weapons if not resupplied. U.S. intelligence, using [[KH-11]] satellite imagery and intercepted Soviet communications, obtained its first clear view of [[Israel]]'s operational missile launchers at Hirbat Zachariah. Despite this intelligence, the U.S. government maintained its policy of "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil," prioritizing crisis management over confronting [[Israel]]'s nuclear status.

## The Carter Malaise

The May 1977 victory of [[Menachem Begin]]'s Likud Party marked a shift in [[Israel]]'s public posture. Begin's government was more overtly committed to the "Samson Option" and the necessity of a nuclear arsenal. His administration intensified nuclear targeting plans against the [[Soviet Union]], which increased [[Israel]]'s demand for U.S. satellite intelligence. Despite [[Israel]]'s official denials, the [[United States]] government, under President [[Jimmy Carter]], maintained its policy of non-confrontation and focused on broader [[Middle East]] peace efforts.

Nuclear cooperation between [[Israel]] and [[South Africa]], which had grown after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], intensified. [[Israel]] provided nuclear expertise in exchange for South African uranium ore and strategic minerals. This collaboration led to a joint nuclear test in the South Indian Ocean on September 22, 1979, detected by a [[VELA satellite]]. Facing political pressure and seeking to protect its nonproliferation policy, the Carter administration downplayed the event. An official review panel attributed the satellite's detection of a flash to a "zoo event" rather than a nuclear explosion. This official obfuscation, while politically convenient, reinforced the policy of deliberate ignorance and created an "embarrassment" for the U.S. when confronted by countries like [[Pakistan]] about the apparent double standard.

## A Secret Agreement

In 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] authorized [[Israel]]'s access to imagery from the [[KH-11]] reconnaissance satellite, altering the strategic intelligence balance in the [[Middle East]]. The KH-11, launched on December 19, 1976, could relay real-time digital photographs of exceptional resolution, giving [[Israel]] a new capacity to monitor military activities within a hundred-mile radius of its borders with [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]].

Officials at the [[NSA]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] opposed the "unpopular decision," arguing it would disrupt the KH-11's orbital schedules and divert collection from American-prioritized targets. Some believed it was a political reward for Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]] following the [[Camp David summit]] with Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]. The Israelis, who considered the Carter administration "naïve and anti-Semitic" compared to the [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Gerald R. Ford]] administrations, viewed the access as inevitable. It was the twenty-eighth formal intelligence pact between the nations since the 1950s, many financed "off-the-books" through [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contingency funds like [[KK MOUNTAIN]], which funneled millions in cash to [[Mossad]] for its operations as a U.S. surrogate in North Africa and the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s "embarrassingly inept reporting" on the [[Iranian Revolution]] had already forced American leadership to rely more heavily on Israeli intelligence.

The strategic value of this satellite access became clear with the [[Osirak bombing]] in June 1981. [[Israel]] used American-supplied F-16s to destroy [[Iraq]]'s nuclear reactor in a preemptive strike. While the [[United States]] State Department issued a formal condemnation, President [[Ronald Reagan]] was reported to have privately quipped, "Boys will be boys." The raid asserted [[Israel]]'s policy of preventing any regional rival from acquiring nuclear weapons, a doctrine rooted in the post-[[Holocaust]] principle of "Never again!" The attack was contentious within [[Israel]]; [[Mossad]] director [[Yitzhak Hofi]] and military intelligence chief [[Yehoshua Saguy]] opposed it for lack of evidence of an active Iraqi bomb program and fear of a negative U.S. reaction. [[Menachem Begin]], however, announced the operation and boasted of destroying a secret underground facility at Osirak, a description that actually matched a similar facility in [[Dimona]]. This revealed to U.S. intelligence that [[Israel]] sought KH-11 access not for defense, but for offensive targeting, including potential targets inside the [[Soviet Union]]. This led to a subsequent review of intelligence-sharing protocols, though the flow of imagery to [[Israel]] continued.

## An Israeli Test

The flash detected by the [[VELA satellite]] on September 22, 1979, over the South Indian Ocean was a joint nuclear test by [[Israel]] and [[South Africa]]. According to Israeli sources cited by Hersh, this was the third such test, involving a low-yield nuclear artillery shell. The test was timed to coincide with a storm to avoid satellite detection, but a break in the weather allowed VELA to capture the characteristic double flash of a nuclear explosion and relay the data to U.S. intelligence.

The discovery created a political dilemma for the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration. Public confirmation would have undermined Carter's nonproliferation agenda and caused significant political fallout. An external investigative body, the Ruina panel, was assembled. Its official conclusion was that the event was "probably not from a nuclear explosion," suggesting alternative causes like a "zoo event" or a meteoroid. This conclusion was disputed by nuclear weapons scientists at Los Alamos, whose internal assessments confirmed the event was nuclear. The incident exposed how political priorities can lead governments to manipulate information, even as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s own internal reports continued to affirm that a test had occurred.

## Israel's Nuclear Spy

[[Jonathan Pollard]], a U.S. Navy intelligence analyst, was [[Israel]]'s first publicly exposed nuclear spy inside the [[United States]] intelligence community. Motivated by ideology and financial compensation, Pollard provided large volumes of highly classified U.S. intelligence. This included critical data on Soviet military targets and air defense systems, information essential for [[Israel]]'s long-range nuclear targeting plans. He was recruited and handled by [[Rafael Eitan]], the head of [[LAKAM]], demonstrating [[Israel]]'s willingness to conduct espionage against its primary ally to obtain intelligence it deemed vital.

The Pollard affair revealed a significant penetration of U.S. intelligence and suggested that high-level Israeli officials, including Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]], were willing to sanitize and then trade sensitive American intelligence with the [[Soviet Union]]. This operation, driven by [[Israel]]'s strategic calculations and a distrust of American reliability, caused a major diplomatic crisis. Though initially presented by [[Israel]] as a "rogue operation," the scandal exposed the complex and often conflicting interests at play in international intelligence.

## An Israeli Asset

In October 1986, the revelations of [[Mordecai Vanunu]] provided an unprecedented view of the [[Dimona]] facility. His detailed testimony and photographs confirmed [[Israel]]'s advanced nuclear capabilities, including the ability to produce thermonuclear weapons. Despite the significance of his disclosures, the international press response was muted. This was partly due to an Israeli intelligence operation that successfully discredited Vanunu's story in the Sunday Mirror, with publisher [[Robert Maxwell]] playing a role in the effort.

The "Samson Option" doctrine continues to evolve. [[Israel]] has reportedly developed low-yield neutron warheads and advanced missile delivery systems. The launch of [[Israel]]'s first satellite in 1988 increased its strategic independence by reducing its reliance on foreign intelligence for targeting. [[Israel]]'s unacknowledged nuclear arsenal remains a critical component of its national defense strategy and a key factor in the geopolitics of the [[Middle East]].

## Epilogue

The dynamics of the Samson Option were demonstrated again during the 1991 [[Persian Gulf War]]. After [[Iraq]] launched Scud missiles at Israeli cities, the government of Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Shamir]] responded by moving nuclear-armed mobile missile launchers into exposed positions aimed at [[Iraq]]. This nuclear alert, detected by U.S. satellites, signaled [[Israel]]'s readiness to use its ultimate deterrent. The attacks were ultimately confirmed to be conventional, averting a nuclear response. The Bush administration, while publicly urging restraint, privately acknowledged that no outside power could prevent [[Israel]] from taking actions it deemed necessary for its survival.

By the mid-1980s, technicians at [[Dimona]] had reportedly manufactured hundreds of low-yield neutron warheads, designed to maximize lethality against troops while minimizing infrastructure damage. This capability, combined with intercontinental ballistic missile technology demonstrated by [[Israel]]'s 1988 satellite launch, established it as a formidable nuclear power. The "Samson Option" was no longer its only nuclear choice; [[Israel]] had developed a diversified arsenal, including nuclear artillery shells and land mines, integrated into its battlefield doctrine. The primary targets of this arsenal were its Arab neighbors. The possibility of nuclear escalation in a future major conflict in the [[Middle East]] had shifted from a last resort to a distinct probability, a final guarantee of "Never again."
