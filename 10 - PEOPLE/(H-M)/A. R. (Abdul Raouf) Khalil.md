A. R. (Abdul Raouf) Khalil is a high-level officer in [[Saudi Arabian intelligence]] and a key [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] front man.[^1] He was a prominent figure in [[Agha Hasan Abedi]]'s network of wealthy Middle Eastern individuals who were shareholders in BCCI and its associated entities.

### Role in BCCI Operations

Khalil was one of the nominees used by Abedi to secretly purchase shares in [[Credit and Commerce American Holdings|CCAH]], the holding company that owned [[First American Bank]].[^2] He was also a recipient of large, fictitious loans from BCCI, such as $168 million, which were used to create the illusion of capital within the bank.[^3]

His involvement in BCCI's operations highlights the bank's strategy of using influential figures to conceal its true ownership and illicit financial activities. Khalil, along with [[Kamal Adham]] and [[Ghaith Pharaon]], held significant shares in BCCI and its subsidiaries, often acquired through these fraudulent loans.[^4]
