Henry R. Myers was a specialist on energy issues for the House Subcommittee on Energy. He, along with [[Peter D. Stockton]], spent nearly fifteen years relaying the suspicions of [[Carl E. Duckett]] and [[John L. Hadden]] to journalists as the views of knowledgeable intelligence sources, leading many reporters to publish these beliefs as "facts." Myers believed that [[Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation|NUMEC]] had been set up solely for the diversion of uranium, and alleged reports of a secure telephone or teletype between NUMEC and the Israeli embassy. He also claimed that [[Richard M. Helms]] believed [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro]] was the head of a group collecting information for [[Israel]].[^1]
