[[Yitzhak Kahan]] was a Supreme Court Justice in [[Israel]] who headed the commission of inquiry into the [[Sabra and Shatila massacres]] in September 1982. The commission found that while the [[Israel|Israeli]] government was not directly involved in the massacres, it was warned in advance that such a tragedy could occur and took no action to prevent it. The report also indicated that [[Ariel Sharon]] had seen a warning letter prior to the events.[^1]

As a result of the commission's findings, [[Yehoshua Sagi|Maj. Gen. Sagi]] was removed from office, and [[Ariel Sharon]] was forced to resign as Defense Minister.[^1]
