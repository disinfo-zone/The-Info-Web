[[Michael Milken]] was a prominent stockbroker known for building his junk-bond fortune at the brokerage house [[Drexel Burnham]]. His activities intersected with the financial operations of the [[Iran-Israel Joint Committee]]'s slush fund.

Large amounts of money from the arms sales to [[Iran]] were funneled through [[USA|American]] banks and held at [[Drexel Burnham]], contributing to Milken's firm's stature and its ability to underwrite huge quantities of junk bonds. These deposits were managed on behalf of [[Israel|Israeli]] front companies.[^1]

In 1987, the [[Iran-Israel Joint Committee]] decided to withdraw its funds from Drexel, a decision that contributed to Milken's growing troubles and ultimately to the fall of Drexel Burnham.[^1]
