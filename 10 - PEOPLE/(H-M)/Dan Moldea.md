[[Dan Moldea]] is an American author known for his investigative work into organized crime and political corruption. He is the author of the 1986 book, *Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA, and the Mob*.[^1]

In *Dark Victory*, Moldea famously labeled [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] as "[[The Octopus]]" due to its extensive and often illicit connections. Investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]] likely derived his own term "[[The Octopus]]" for the complex network he was investigating from Moldea's earlier work. However, the text notes that even Moldea, at the time of his book's publication in 1986, could not have known the full extent of this "creature's" reach, specifically its tentacles within the [[National Security Council|NSC]].[1]
