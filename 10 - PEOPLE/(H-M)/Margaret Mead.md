Margaret Mead was a renowned American cultural anthropologist. In 1969, she delivered a rousing conference speech that contributed to the American Association for the Advancement of Science's decision to admit the [[Parapsychological Association]] to its ranks of approved disciplines. Her support helped lend a degree of legitimacy to the field of parapsychology, which had long struggled for scientific acceptance.[^1]
