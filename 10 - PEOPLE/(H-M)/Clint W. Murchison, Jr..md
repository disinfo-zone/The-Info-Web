[[Clint W. Murchison, Jr.]] was a Director of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] and the owner of the Dallas Cowboys NFL football team. He was the son of [[Clint Murchison, Sr.]], a figure described as being cut from the same political cloth as [[H.L. Hunt]], both known for their significant influence and connections.[^1]

His family cultivated relationships not only with powerful figures on the far right but also with individuals such as [[J. Edgar Hoover]], [[Richard Nixon]], organized crime figures, and [[Lyndon Johnson]]. The Murchison family's rise to power was closely tied to their connections in Texas oil.[^1]

[[Clint W. Murchison, Jr.]]'s father, [[Clint Murchison, Sr.]], was an ardent supporter of Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s anti-communist crusade. McCarthy, [[Richard Nixon]], and [[J. Edgar Hoover]] were frequent visitors to the exclusive Hotel Del Charro in La Jolla, California, which Murchison, Sr. opened in the early 1950s. [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s vacations at the hotel were often covered by Murchison, Sr.[^1]

The Murchison family's business dealings also intersected with organized crime. A significant portion of the Murchison Oil Lease Company in Oklahoma was owned by [[Gerardo Catena]], a chief lieutenant to the [[Genovese Crime Family]]. Furthermore, [[Clint W. Murchison, Jr.]] was involved in real estate dealings with [[Jimmy Hoffa]] in Florida, and his family's affairs were tightly interwoven with the scandal surrounding [[Bobby Baker]], a close associate of [[Lyndon Johnson]], which involved numerous questionable deals with organized crime figures in Las Vegas, Chicago, Louisiana, and the Caribbean.[^1]

His involvement with [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] placed him among a group of influential individuals with ties to government and intelligence, including [[Robert Maheu]], [[Michael A. McManus]], [[Robert Booth Nichols]], and [[George K. Pender]].[^1]
