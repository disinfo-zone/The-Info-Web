Colonel Robert Keenan was the commanding officer of the [[Systems Exploitation Detachment]] (SED) under the command of [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM). In this role (July 1978 - May 1980[^1]), he was responsible for overseeing the activities and personnel within the detachment. When [[Frederick Atwater]] proposed the idea of forming a remote viewing team within the Army, it was Keenan who had the authority to approve or reject the proposal.

Keenan ultimately approved Atwater's proposal, which led to the establishment of the remote viewing program in 1977. This decision marked a significant step in the Army's exploration of paranormal phenomena for intelligence gathering purposes.
