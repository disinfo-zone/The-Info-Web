Robin Leigh-Pemberton served as the Governor of the [[Bank of England]].[^1]

### Role in BCCI Scandal

Leigh-Pemberton, along with Deputy Governor [[Eddie George]], was aware of the disastrous 1990 Price Waterhouse audit of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], which revealed that many of BCCI's transactions were "fraudulent and deceitful."[^2] Despite this knowledge, the [[Bank of England]] agreed to a plan in spring 1990 to allow BCCI to move its headquarters to [[Abu Dhabi]] and for [[Zayed bin Sultan AL-Nahayan|Sheikh Zayed]] to take over the bank.[^3] This action effectively concealed BCCI's problems from its depositors and creditors.[^4]

On June 28, 1991, Leigh-Pemberton and George decided to act, informing the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] of the impending seizure of BCCI in the [[United Kingdom]].[^5] The Bank of England had been reluctant to shut down BCCI, despite knowing of its insolvency, and had been trying to persuade [[Sheikh Zayed]] to inject more money.[^6]
