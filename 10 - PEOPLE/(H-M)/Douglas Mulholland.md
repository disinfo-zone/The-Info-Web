Douglas Mulholland was the intelligence liaison at the [[Treasury Department]].[^1]

### Role in BCCI Investigation

In January 1985, a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent delivered an unusual document to Mulholland's office, which contained information about the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]]'s money-laundering activities.[^1] Mulholland stated in Senate testimony that he had never seen an agency report delivered in such a format, indicating its sensitive nature.[^1]

Mulholland was reportedly impressed by the report and hand-carried it to Secretary of the Treasury [[Donald Regan]].[^1] He also sent it to the deputy comptroller of the currency, [[Robert R. Bench]].[^1]

Despite the significance of the information, Mulholland later claimed he could not remember what he did after receiving the memo, and his memory on this point was classified by the CIA.[^1] A subsequent CIA memo described Mulholland's actions, noting that he reported to the CIA that he had carried the report directly to the Secretary for his further disposition.[^1]
