[[J.H.]] was a retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent in Fresno, California, who served as a contact for [[Cheri Seymour]] and [[Michael Riconosciuto]]. He was previously identified as "R.J." in the Internet version of *The Last Circle*.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] frequently communicated with J.H., attempting to negotiate entry into the Federal Witness Protection Program in exchange for information on high-level corruption, drug trafficking, and money laundering. Riconosciuto provided J.H. with details about "The Company," a drug/arms organization, and its activities, including the alleged involvement of [[Robert Booth Nichols]], [[Michael Abbell]], [[Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela|Gilbert Rodriguez]], and [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Jose Londono]] in illicit financial transactions.[^1]

J.H. verified some of [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s information, including Riconosciuto's presence in [[Lebanon]], but could not verify the details of the drug operation. He also confirmed that [[Brian Leighton]] recalled [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s help with "[[The Company]]" case, including leading law enforcement to a marijuana cache. However, J.H. ultimately did not facilitate Riconosciuto's entry into witness protection, and his responses to Riconosciuto's information became increasingly limited.[^1]

J.H. was also contacted by [[Cheri Seymour]] regarding [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s request to connect with someone trustworthy at [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]]. Riconosciuto advised that J.H. should have someone "totally uncoupled" from him make inquiries into Riconosciuto's files to avoid exposing an audit trail, as Riconosciuto claimed to know [[PROMIS]] and [[FOIMS]] (Field Office Information Management System) "inside out" and helped develop their internal tracking audit trail.[^1]
