Charles Frank Jordan was a former special agent for the [[U.S. Customs Service]] in South Florida. In 1986, he was accused of taking bribes from drug traffickers smuggling large quantities of cocaine into the [[United States]]. When he realized law enforcement was pursuing him, he became a fugitive, earning a place on the [[FBI]]'s Most Wanted Fugitives list for over two years[^1].

In 1989, the Customs Service requested that the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]'s [[Remote Viewing]] unit target Jordan to locate him. All six viewers on the [[Fort Meade]] team were tasked with finding him, but their initial sessions produced conflicting information, placing Jordan in Mexico, Minnesota, and Florida[^1].

[[Angela Dellafiora]], however, provided a clear signal, stating that Jordan was in "Lowell, Wyoming." Although the town was actually Lovell, Wyoming, Dellafiora's phonetic perception proved accurate. She later sensed that Jordan was living "at or near a campground that had a large boulder at its entrance" and that "an old Indian burial ground is located nearby"[^1].

Customs agent William Green increased the local law enforcement effort, and a ranger at Yellowstone National Park spotted Jordan, leading to his capture. Jordan was found at a campground located on the border of an old Indian burial ground, roughly fifty miles from Lovell, Wyoming. [[FBI]] investigations later confirmed he had been in Lovell a few weeks prior[^1].

Jordan's capture, largely attributed to Dellafiora's remote viewing, became one of the most celebrated cases in the program's twenty-five-year history, demonstrating the practical application of psychic abilities in intelligence operations[^1].
