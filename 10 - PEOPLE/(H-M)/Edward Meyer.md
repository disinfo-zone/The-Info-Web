[[Edward Meyer]] (Edward C. "Shy" Meyer) was the [[U.S. Army]] Chief of Staff during the early years of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]]. He tacitly supported the program, along with [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|INSCOM]] commander [[William Rolya]] and Secretary of the Army [[Clifford Alexander]]. His support, though not always overt, contributed to the project's ability to continue operating despite its controversial nature and minimal budget.[^1]
