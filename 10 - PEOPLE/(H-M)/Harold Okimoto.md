[[Harold Okimoto]] is a figure linked to [[Robert Booth Nichols]] and alleged organized crime activities, particularly the [[Yakuza]]. He is described as a 67-year-old car dealer in Hawaii and believed by some sources to be a top Japanese organized crime figure based in Hawaii, acting as a top agent in the [[Yakuza]] overseas.[1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that [[Robert Booth Nichols]] was under Okimoto's influence and referred to Nichols as Okimoto's "god-son." Okimoto was also represented as an intelligence person who had worked under [[Frank Carlucci]] for years, and reportedly performed services for the [[United States Government|U.S. government]] during [[World War II]], for which he was rewarded.[1]

Okimoto's company, [[Island Tobacco]], was said to sell cigarettes at the Casino du Liban, which was controlled by the [[Syria|Syrian]] mob and used as a front by narcotics people.[1]
