Zafar Iqbal took over as head of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] in late 1990, after the firing of [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] and [[Swaleh Naqvi]].[^1] He was also responsible for inspecting the "dancing girls" for clients.[^2]

### Role at BCCI

As head of BCCI, Iqbal was the bank's president when [[William Ryback]] of the [[Federal Reserve]] demanded to see the audit reports.[^3] He was forced by Ryback to agree that the audit would not be brought back to the United States, nor would the [[Bank of England]] allow a copy to be taken.[^4]
