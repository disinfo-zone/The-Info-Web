John Marsh was the Secretary of the [[U.S. Army]]. On August 24, 1984, he authorized negotiations for the transfer of the [[Psychoenergetics|psychoenergetics]] program (which included [[Remote Viewing]]) to the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]. This decision came after a period of uncertainty and bureaucratic maneuvering following the early retirement of [[Albert Stubblebine]] and the temporary cancellation of the program[^1].

Marsh's authorization was a crucial step in ensuring the continuation of the U.S. government's psychic research efforts, despite the ongoing debates and controversies surrounding them[^1].
