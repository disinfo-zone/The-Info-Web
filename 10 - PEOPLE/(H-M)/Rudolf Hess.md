Rudolf Hess was a prominent figure in [[Nazi Germany]], serving as Adolf Hitler's deputy. He is known for his mysterious solo flight to Scotland in 1941, an event that has been linked to the use of astrology and the occult in psychological warfare.[^1]

Hess's flight was allegedly influenced by a phony horoscope created by [[Sybil Leek]], a British astrologer working for [[British Intelligence]]. This act of deception was part of a larger effort to exploit the Nazi belief in the supernatural. After his capture, Hess was declared insane by Hitler, and his actions led to the mass arrest of astrologers and other practitioners of the occult in Germany.[^1]
