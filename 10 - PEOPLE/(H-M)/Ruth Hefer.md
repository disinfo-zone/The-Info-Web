# Ruth Hefer

Ruth Hefer was a journalist who reported on [[Uri Geller]]'s purported psychic abilities. In the fall of 1970, while Geller was giving a [[Telepathy|telepathy]] demonstration at the Tzavta Theater in Tel Aviv, he became physically ill and claimed that [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the president of [[Egypt]], "had just died or is about to die"[^1].

Hefer, who was in the audience, immediately went to a pay phone to call her contact at Israel Radio International. She learned there was no news about Nasser. When she returned to the theater, Geller was still looking ill. Twenty minutes later, someone ran into the room shouting that Radio Cairo had just announced President Nasser's death from a heart attack at 6:00 that evening[^1].

This event significantly boosted Geller's reputation, with Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] reportedly quipping, "Donâ€™t ask me... Ask Uri Geller" when asked about [[Israel|Israel's]] future[^1].
