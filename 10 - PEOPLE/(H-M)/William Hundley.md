[[William Hundley]] was a former Chief of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section. He was retained by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] to plead its case to top [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] officials after [[Marvin Rudnick]] "opened fire" on [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] with a press release detailing payments to [[Sal Pisello]]'s company, Consultants for World Records, which was shared with [[New York]] organized crime figures.[^1]

Hundley had recently joined Strauss's firm, Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. He confirmed that he met with [[David Margolis]], the strike force's chief, and [[Michael DeFeo]], his deputy, to tell them that [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] was willing to cooperate in any organized crime investigation. He also discussed the Pisello case with [[John Newcomer]], the new head of the strike force in Los Angeles, and inquired about [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s status in the investigation.[^1]

[[Marvin Rudnick]] pointed out that Hundley's picture was on the wall, along with [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Edwin Meese]]'s, in Margolis's office, which Margolis pointed to when he threatened Rudnick.[^1]
