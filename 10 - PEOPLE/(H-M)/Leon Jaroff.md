Leon Jaroff was a senior editor at *Time* magazine. He is known for his article, "The Magician and the Think Tank," published on March 12, 1973, which reported on [[Uri Geller]]'s testing at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] and the controversy surrounding it[^1].

Jaroff's article was influenced by [[George Lawrence]], an [[ARPA]] project manager, who told Jaroff that Geller was a "charlatan" and encouraged the magazine to write an expos√©. Lawrence's unauthorized communication with a reporter was a violation of his security clearance, leading to an investigation by the [[CIA]][^1].

Jaroff's reporting contributed to the public debate and skepticism surrounding Geller's abilities and the government's involvement in [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] research[^1].
