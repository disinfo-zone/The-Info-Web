Ray Hyman is a psychologist and a prominent figure in the scientific skepticism movement. He was contracted by [[ARPA]] in 1973 to evaluate [[Uri Geller]]'s purported psychic abilities at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. Along with [[George Lawrence]] and [[Robert Van de Castle]], Hyman concluded that anyone who believed in Geller's powers was falling for the "ridiculous"[^1].

Hyman, along with [[Martin Gardner]], joined forces in an anti-Geller crusade. He was critical of [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]]'s methodology, echoing Gardner's criticisms of [[J. B. Rhine]]'s research, citing loose laboratory controls, skewing of data, and the influence of experimenter bias[^1].

In 1983, Hyman weighed in on the [[James Randi]] hoax against the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research, stating that Randi was "very upset by Gellerâ€™s using trickery to deceive scientists. He thought it was very immoral. And he felt that it was a prostitution of his beloved magic"[^1].

In 1995, Hyman was one of the team leaders for the [[American Institutes for Research]]'s evaluation of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Star Gate program]], which ultimately recommended its cancellation. However, this evaluation was criticized for its limited scope and the researchers' pre-existing skeptical biases[^1].
