James Johnston was the Director of Contract Administration in the Justice Management Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. He was implicated in allegations surrounding the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]].

According to a source of [[Ronald LeGrand]], Johnston was one of three senior DOJ officials, along with [[Miles Matthews]] and [[James Knapp]], whom [[Lowell Jensen]] allegedly relied upon to engineer [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s problems. The source claimed that Jensen wanted to get Inslaw "out of the way and give the business to friends."[^1]

However, when interviewed by the Special Counsel, James Johnston stated that he did not believe he had ever met James Knapp, who was alleged to have conspired with him to implement Jensen's scheme. Johnston also told the Special Counsel that he never discussed Inslaw or [[PROMIS]] with Lowell Jensen, and that he never received any directions from any superior at the DOJ regarding [[INSLAW]]. The Special Counsel's investigation found no credible evidence to support the allegations against Johnston or any connection between him and a conspiracy related to Inslaw or PROMIS.[^1]
