Joan E. Jacoby received a B.A. in sociology at Boston University and an M.A. in statistics from The American University. She is a published criminologist with several books and countless articles.

Joan co-headed the 1969 team to create [[PROMIS]] (along with [[Charles R. Work]] with project manager [[Bill Hamilton]]) while director of the [[Office of Crime Analysis of the District of Columbia]] as part of an [[LEAA]] grant program for the [[U.S. Attorney's office]] DC.

This was not the only information system Jacoby was involved with. In 1970 she wrote a paper called “Project TRACE—A System for the Tracking, Retrieval and Analysis of Criminal Events” for the Nov 12, 1970, Urban and Regional Information Systems Proceedings[^2]. [[Project TRACE]], or Tracking Retrieval and Analysis of Criminal Events[^1], was a competitor of PROMIS.

After her time at the Office of Crime Analysis she served as executive director of the [[National Center for Prosecution Management]], a nonprofit corporation set up by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] with [[LEAA funding]] that provided management and technical assistance to prosecutors nationwide and conducted research on the prosecution role and function.

In 1975, Joan became a research associate at the Bureau of Social Science Research where she directed national programs of research in prosecution and criminal justice.

She went on to become the Executive Director of the Jefferson Institute, Washington, DC.
