[[Ronald Moultrie]] is the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence & Security. He testified before Congress in May 2022 at a historic public hearing on [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP).[^1]

### Congressional Testimony on UAP

In his testimony, Moultrie acknowledged the reality of UAP and the potential threat they pose to national security. However, he also stated that the [[Pentagon]] was unaware of UAP incursions near sensitive nuclear facilities, a statement that was contradicted by historical records. He also claimed that, other than the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and [[Project Blue Book]], there had been no other government programs to investigate UAP, a statement that has been challenged by whistleblowers who allege the existence of a long-standing "Legacy Program."[^1]
