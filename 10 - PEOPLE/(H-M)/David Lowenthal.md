David Lowenthal was one of the initial stockholders in the Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC). He had helped bring illegal immigrants into [[Israel]] before 1948. His involvement, along with [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro]]'s ties to [[Israel]], fueled suspicions within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] that NUMEC was part of a long-range Israeli intelligence scheme to divert uranium.[^1]
