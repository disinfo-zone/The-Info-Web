[[Raymond Jenkins]] was a private investigator and former Merced College Police Chief. He was recruited by Sheriff [[Ken Mattheys]] in October 1984 to investigate [[Ron Van Meter]]'s disappearance and help clean up the Mariposa Sheriff's Department. Jenkins, along with retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Tom Walsh]], concluded that [[Ron Van Meter]] was murdered after obtaining evidence of drug trafficking within the sheriff's department.[^1]

Jenkins' investigation also led him to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] (Music Corporation of America), parent company to Curry Company, where a major drug network had surfaced in Yosemite National Park. He later joined forces with [[Cheri Seymour]] in the investigation of Van Meter's death and the broader corruption in Mariposa County. Jenkins followed the drug trail from Yosemite National Park back to the Mariposa airport, where sheriff's deputies were observed loading and unloading packages from planes.[^1]
