Mark Kesselman was formerly associated with [[Allen and Company]] in New York City, a Wall Street Investment Bank. He resigned from the firm in February 1984.

In late 1983, Kesselman was asked by [[Charles Allen]] to assist Allen's nephew, [[Nathaniel Kramer]], in an analysis of a company in Northern Virginia. Kesselman did not recall the name of the company, but remembered that [[Dominic Laiti]], [[Paul Wormeli]], and [[Robert Burke]] were executives of this company, and that it was developing computer software for police patrol cars. Kesselman spent one day in Northern Virginia reviewing this company and did not recall any additional involvement with it thereafter. The Special Counsel's investigation found that Kesselman's testimony did not support [[Bill Hamilton]]'s claim that the 1983 New York trip was to raise money related to [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] or [[PROMIS]].[^1]
