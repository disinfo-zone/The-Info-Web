Adolf Hitler was the leader of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Party]] and the dictator of [[Nazi Germany]] from 1934 to 1945. He was the central figure in the rise of Nazism, the Holocaust, and World War II.[^1]

While Hitler himself was reportedly dismissive of mysticism, his regime had a complex relationship with the occult. Figures like [[Heinrich Himmler]] were deeply invested in paranormal research, and the Nazi government's use of astrology and other forms of divination for propaganda purposes is well-documented. Hitler's reaction to [[Rudolf Hess]]'s flight to Scotland, which he attributed to the influence of astrologers, led to a crackdown on occult practices in Germany.[^1]
