Peter Maris was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] physicist who, along with [[Ken Kress]], an engineer from the Office of Technical Service (OTS), tasked [[Pat Price]] with remote viewing the mysterious Soviet military research facility at Semipalatinsk (URDF-3). Maris and Kress were the CIA officials who brought in the coordinates for the site, which was also known as P-NUTS (probable nuclear underground test site) by Air Force intelligence. They knew little about the facility, only that it was a "research facility."[^1]

Maris was present during Price's remote viewing sessions of Semipalatinsk, where Price described a large gantry crane, the construction of large metal spheres, and unique welding techniques. Initially, Maris and Kress were unsure what to make of Price's descriptions, but they later confirmed the existence of the crane and the spheres through satellite photography. The accuracy of Price's remote viewing, particularly his description of the crane, was so impressive that it helped secure funding for SRI's psi research for several years.[^1]
