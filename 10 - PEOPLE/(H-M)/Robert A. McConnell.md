Robert A. McConnell was a physicist who authored the paper "ESPâ€”Fact or Fancy?" His work was discussed by Nobel Laureate [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], who had a lively conversation about [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]] in the early 1950s[^1].

Jung remarked on how some age-old mysteries never change, and that attempts to explain away seemingly miraculous results often fail against the facts. McConnell's paper contributed to the ongoing debate about the reality and nature of anomalous mental phenomena[^1].
