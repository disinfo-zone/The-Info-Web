Eugene Holley was a former [[Georgia]] state senator who introduced [[Bert Lance]] to [[Agha Hasan Abedi]].[^1] He was the first person prosecuted under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] for paying bribes in [[Qatar]].[^2]

### Legal Issues and BCCI Connections

Holley was convicted of bank fraud in 1980 and sentenced to ten years in jail.[^3] He had set up a [[Cayman Islands|Cayman]] oil company and accumulated a $17 million debt, from which Abedi bailed him out.[^4]

In October 1977, Holley arranged a meeting between Bert Lance and [[BCCI]] chieftains Abedi and [[Swaleh Naqvi]] at [[New York]]'s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.[^5]
