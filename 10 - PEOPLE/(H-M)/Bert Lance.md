T. Bertram (Bert) Lance was President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s budget director and former chairman of [[National Bank of Georgia]].[^1]

### Political and Banking Career

Lance gained prominence as Jimmy Carter's budget director but later resigned due to a congressional investigation into financial improprieties.[^2] He became chief executive of the National Bank of Georgia, which was the largest lender to Jimmy Carter's peanut warehouse.[^3] He borrowed $2.6 million to finance his purchase of stock in the bank.[^4]

### Involvement with BCCI

[[Eugene Holley]] introduced Lance to [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] in October 1977.[^5] Abedi helped Lance finalize the acquisition of National Bank of Georgia from Lance in January 1978, and on the same day, Abedi paid off Lance's $3.5 million bank loan.[^6] Lance's financial difficulties were leveraged by Abedi to facilitate BCCI's entry into the U.S. market.[^7]

Lance played a key role in the acquisition of [[Financial General Bankshares]], which later became [[First American Bank]].[^8] He recruited his friend and attorney [[Clark Clifford]] to represent Abedi, BCCI, and the front men in the Financial General suit.[^9] BCCI also hired Lance as a consultant at a salary of $100,000.[^10]
