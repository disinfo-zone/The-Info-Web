[[Jackie Keith]] was an [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|INSCOM]] civilian who worked in special operations at Arlington Hall, home to some of the more "James Bond-ish" elements of the U.S. espionage community. He was selected for the original [[STARGATE PROJECT|Gondola Wish]] team. Keith was known for being involved in numerous "cloak-and-dagger schemes."[^1]

Keith dropped out of the original Gondola Wish team not long after being selected, but he continued to task the remote viewers with targets related to his own operations. He was involved in the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration's plans for a second hostage rescue mission in Iran, working with the remote viewers to locate the dispersed hostages. In 1980, while in the control room during a remote viewing session, Keith suffered a fatal heart attack. His death was a tragedy for the unit, as he was only in his late thirties, recently married, and his young widow was pregnant with his first child.[^1]
