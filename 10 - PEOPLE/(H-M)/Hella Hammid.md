# Hella Hammid

Hella Hammid was a professional photographer and psychic who participated in [[Project Deep Quest]], a unique psychic functioning experiment conducted in the summer of 1977. She joined the [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] team, including [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Dale Graff]], and worked alongside [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Stephan Schwartz]][^1].

Hammid, along with Swann, was tasked with locating a previously unidentified shipwreck on the seafloor near Catalina Island using [[Map Dowsing]]. She would "sort of look at the map not as much with my eyes as sort of get the feeling of it," and mark locations where she sensed a wreck. Her marks, along with Swann's, were used to pinpoint a single target for the *Taurus I* submersible[^1].

For the classified [[U.S. Air Force]] project within Deep Quest, Hammid was placed inside the submerged *Taurus I*, 500 feet underwater and 375 miles away. She quickly identified which photograph, from a set of six sealed envelopes, was correct, indicating the location of Puthoff and Graff who were acting as a beacon on land. This demonstrated her ability to perform long-distance [[Remote Viewing]] in a challenging environment[^1].
