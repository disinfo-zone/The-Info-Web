[[Howard Baker]] was a former [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] and a member of the Board of Directors of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Corporation. He later served as [[Ronald Reagan]]'s chief of staff.[^1]

Baker was on the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] board from January 4, 1985, to March 2, 1987, when he resigned to accept the position of chief of staff to President [[Ronald Reagan]]. He returned to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s board of directors in March 1989, just months after the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretaps on [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] had been shut down (Fall 1988).[^1]

[[Edwin Meese]], [[William F. Weld]], and [[Arnold Burns]] complained to Baker about Meese's conduct. Weld stated that his superiors often asked if he could not close pending investigations of Meese's friends. Baker urged Weld and Burns to remain on staff, but they, along with four top aides, resigned from the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on March 30, 1988, in an unprecedented mass exit.[^1]
