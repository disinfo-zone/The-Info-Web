Major [[Moshe Hebroni]] was the chief of staff for the director of [[Israeli Military Intelligence]], [[Yehoshua Sagi]]. He was a member of the initial [[Iran-Israel Joint Committee]].[^1]

[[Moshe Hebroni|Hebroni]] was involved in expediting the export license for tires sold to [[Iran]] in April 1980. He also received a call from [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] regarding [[Sayeed Mehdi Kashani|Kashani's]] request for military aid from [[Israel]], and instructed [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe]] to bring [[Sayeed Mehdi Kashani|Kashani]] directly to the general headquarters of [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]/MI.[^1]

[[Moshe Hebroni|Hebroni]] was the duty officer who received the letter from [[Pierre Gemayel]] to [[Ariel Sharon]] warning of the impending [[Sabra and Shatila massacres]]. He made copies of the letter and informed [[Yehoshua Sagi|Sagi]]. After the massacres, [[Moshe Hebroni|Hebroni]] was allowed to spend three months as head of branch in the External Relations Department, a period during which he could remove any documentation that might implicate him and [[Yehoshua Sagi|Sagi]] in the massacres.[^1]

[[Moshe Hebroni|Hebroni]] later worked for the [[Jewish Agency]] and was an unofficial adviser to [[Yitzhak Shamir]] after leaving [[Mossad]] in 1989. He confirmed [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe's]] access to highly sensitive intelligence material.[^1]
