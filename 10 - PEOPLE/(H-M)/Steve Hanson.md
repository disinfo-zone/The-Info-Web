[[Steve Hanson]] was an Army civilian photo-interpreter and an early member of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Gondola Wish]] (later [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]]) remote viewing unit. He was a devout Christian and one of the four Army civilians in the initial group of candidates selected by [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] and [[Murray Watt|Scotty Watt]].[^1]

Hanson was known to "cool down" before a remote viewing session by reading Bible verses. However, he eventually faded from the remote viewing scene, as he had problems relaxing into the groove of remote viewing itself, often yanking himself out of the "zone" with worries about whether he was doing it correctly.[^1]
