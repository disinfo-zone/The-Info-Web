Janet Mitchell was an assistant to [[Karlis Osis]], the director of research at the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR). She worked with Osis on a series of experiments involving [[Ingo Swann]] and purported [[Out-of-Body Experience|out-of-body experiences]] (OBEs), also known as traveling [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]][^1].

In these experiments, Swann was wired to a Beckman Dynograph and instructed to "practice floating up out-of-the-body to the ceiling and utilize my out-of-body ‘eyes’ to spy down on the targets hidden on the suspended trays." Mitchell would enter the room with a box containing a hidden object, place it on the tray, and then indicate to Swann that the experiment had begun[^1].

Mitchell and Osis were reportedly thrilled with the results, particularly when Swann, instead of trying to articulate what he saw, drew it. They planned to repeat these experiments under tightly controlled laboratory conditions and submit the results to the Psychology Board of America for review[^1].
