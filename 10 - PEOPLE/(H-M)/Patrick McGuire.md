[[Patrick McGuire]] worked for [[Wayne Reeder]] and subsequently joined the [[Montana Freeman]] in Jordan, Montana. He was arrested during the [[Montana Freeman siege]]. [[Peter Zokosky]] reportedly testified on McGuire's behalf as a character witness at the Freeman trial.[^1]

McGuire also provided a Declaration on behalf of [[Jimmy Hughes]]. In this Declaration, McGuire noted that he had spoken with Reeder's lawyer, [[Clay Weed]], who stated that it was not in Reeder's interest to address the Nichols's or their illegal activities at the Bingo operation, as it would jeopardize Reeder's investment.[^1]
