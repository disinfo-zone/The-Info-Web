[[Manfred Herrmann]] was a German expatriate in his 60s who owned an automobile spare-parts company in [[Guatemala City]] known as [[Sedra]]. He was involved in [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence operations in [[Guatemala]].[^1]

Herrmann was recruited to represent [[Ora Group|Ora]], an [[Israel|Israeli]] arms-running company, in [[Guatemala]]. His partner, [[Baldur K. Kleine]], was the representative in Maitland, [[Florida]], coordinating activities in [[Central America]]. After [[Robert Maxwell]] took over [[Degem]], [[Rafi Eitan]] asked [[Earl Brian]] to provide [[Baldur K. Kleine|Kleine]] with the [[PROMIS]] software, complete with its "trap door." [[Baldur K. Kleine|Kleine]] then passed the program to Herrmann, who also received the [[Israel|Israeli]] version of [[PROMIS]].[^1]

Herrmann's Sedra company, in conjunction with [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell's]] [[Degem]], played a key role in implementing [[PROMIS]] in [[Guatemala]]. This involved setting up terminals in offices, railway stations, airports, and even remote roadblocks, as part of a system to track suspected dissidents. This venture was a major success from an intelligence perspective, enabling the tracking of individuals even under false names.[^1]
