[[Nezar Hindawi]] is a Syrian national who was involved in a 1986 plot to bomb an [[El Al]] plane. He was recruited by his cousin, [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah]], as part of an [[Rafi Eitan|Israeli]] "black" operation designed to discredit [[Syria]].

Hindawi was instructed to ensure his pregnant Irish girlfriend, Ann-Marie Murphy, boarded an [[El Al]] flight with explosives in her bag. He was led to believe the money for this operation came from "Syrian brothers on behalf of the Palestinians." He arranged for her to receive the bomb package in the [[Heathrow Airport|El Al]] departure lounge after passing through security, expecting her to die in the explosion along with other passengers.

The plot was foiled by [[Israel|Israeli]] security, who were aware of the operation. Hindawi was arrested and subsequently jailed for 45 years. His actions led to [[Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher's]] government closing down the [[Syrian Embassy in London|Syrian Embassy]] in London.
