[[John LaMothe]] was a [[U.S. Army]] Captain and the author of the 1972 [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] report, "[[Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR]]." This 174-page classified report reviewed and evaluated Soviet research in the field of "revolutionary methods of influencing behavior," with a particular focus on [[Parapsychology|psi]] phenomena and its potential military applications.[^1]

LaMothe's report highlighted the perceived threat of Soviet [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]] capabilities, suggesting they could be used to disable U.S. military equipment, access top-secret documents, influence leaders, and even cause instant death. While some of his sources were considered biased in favor of psi research, the report contributed significantly to the U.S. intelligence community's concern about a "[[Psi Gap|psi gap]]" and spurred further U.S. investment in psychic research programs.[^1]
