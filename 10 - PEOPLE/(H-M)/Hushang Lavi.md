[[Hushang Lavi]] was an [[Iran|Iranian]] Jew living in the [[USA|U.S.]]. He was a known arms dealer and worked for [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence. He left [[Iran]] under the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] to live in the [[USA|United States]]. From the [[USA|U.S.]], he frequently visited [[Israel]] and was recruited by [[Mossad]] in the late 1970s as an intelligence asset to further [[Israel|Israel's]] arms-sales policies.[^1]

[[Hushang Lavi|Lavi]] coordinated the details of the October 1980 [[Washington meeting (October, 1980)|Washington meeting]] between [[USA|American]] and [[Iran|Iranian]] officials, where [[Ahmed Omshei]] outlined the [[Israel|Israeli]] plan for hostage release. His work for the [[Israel|Israeli]] government ended in 1983 because he refused to heed warnings about his unauthorized moonlighting in arms with the [[Hashemi brothers]], among others.[^1]
