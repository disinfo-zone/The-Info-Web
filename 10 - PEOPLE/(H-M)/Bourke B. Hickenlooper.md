Bourke B. Hickenlooper was a conservative Republican Senator from [[Iowa]]. He was also chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. In a closed session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 6, 1961, he testily interrupted [[Christian A. Herter]], then Secretary of State, stating, "I think the Israelis have just lied to us like horse thieves on this thing." He accused [[Israel]] of consistently distorting, misrepresenting, and falsifying facts regarding their secret nuclear reactor facility at [[Dimona]].[^1]
