[[John Robert]] is the pseudonym for a close friend and former U.S. Army colleague of [[Luis Elizondo]]. He is described as a trusted confidant who was aware of Elizondo's involvement in the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and provided him with support and advice throughout his journey.[^1]

### Relationship with Luis Elizondo

John Robert and [[Luis Elizondo]] served together in the Army in Korea in the 1990s and developed a deep and lasting friendship. After leaving the military, both men continued to work in the intelligence community for different three-letter agencies. They were so close that they carpooled to work together every day from their homes on Kent Island, Maryland.[^1]

John Robert was one of the few people who knew about Elizondo's involvement in the [[Stargate Project]] successor program and his training in [[Remote Viewing]]. He was also a liaison between his own agency and AATIP, and he was the one who initially recommended Elizondo for the program. He served as a sounding board for Elizondo, offering him brutally honest advice and helping him to navigate the treacherous internal politics of the Pentagon.[^1]

When Elizondo decided to resign from the Pentagon, John Robert was the first person he told. While he was initially skeptical of Elizondo's chances of success, he ultimately supported his decision and remained a loyal friend and ally.[^1]
