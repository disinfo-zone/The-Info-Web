Morton H. Halperin was a close aide to [[Henry A. Kissinger]] on the [[National Security Council]] staff. He recalled that Kissinger believed it was good to spread nuclear weapons around the world and that if he were the Israelis, he would get nuclear weapons. Kissinger did not believe that the [[United States]] should try to talk them out of it. Halperin also noted that Kissinger believed [[Japan]], as well as [[Israel]], would be better off with the bomb than without it, viewing nuclear weapons as essential to their national security.[^1]
