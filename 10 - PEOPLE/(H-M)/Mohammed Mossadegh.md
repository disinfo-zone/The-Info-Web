[[Mohammed Mossadegh]] was the Prime Minister of [[Iran]]. In late 1950 and early 1951, the Majlis (Parliament) passed an act nationalizing oil, leading to the withdrawal of the British [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]]. This resulted in [[Mohammed Mossadegh|Mossadegh]] being in charge of a nation in uproar, with fierce internal conflicts and street riots.[^1]

[[Mohammed Mossadegh|Mossadegh]] was overthrown in 1953, and [[Kermit Roosevelt]] and [[Miles Copeland]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] helped restore the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] to power. [[Mehdi Bazargan]], the first prime minister appointed by [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini's]] revolutionary government, was a supporter of [[Mohammed Mossadegh|Mossadegh]] and a member of the National Front.[^1]
