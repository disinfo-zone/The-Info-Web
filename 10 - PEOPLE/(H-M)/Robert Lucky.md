[[Robert Lucky]] was a [[Bell Labs]] scientist and the editor of the prestigious *Proceedings of the IEEE* electrical engineering society journal. He initially hesitated to publish [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]]'s paper on remote viewing in 1976. However, after Puthoff and Targ visited Bell Labs to answer questions from skeptical scientists, Lucky was impressed.[^1]

He eventually conducted some of his own informal remote viewing experiments and became convinced of its reality, stating, "Psychic stuff is really not much more far-fetched than some of the physics behind the laser." His decision to publish the paper in a respected scientific journal contributed to the growing, albeit controversial, recognition of remote viewing within the scientific community.[^1]
