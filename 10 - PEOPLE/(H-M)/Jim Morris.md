[[Jim Morris]] was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] counterintelligence officer. He sought assistance from the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] psychics for a case involving a [[KGB]] "illegal" (a deep-cover officer) who had been arrested in South Africa. The KGB agent was not cooperating with interrogations, and Morris hoped the remote viewers could provide information on how the agent was decoding his messages.[^1]

Morris worked with [[Norm Everheart]], who tasked [[Ken Bell]] and [[Mel Riley]] to remote-view the KGB agent. Bell's "telepathic interrogation" revealed details about the agent's family and a hidden pocket calculator, which was later confirmed to have been used for coding messages. Morris confirmed the accuracy of the remote viewers' descriptions, including the agent's upstairs room, gray clothes, and the presence of two interrogators. This successful operation helped close the case.[^1]
