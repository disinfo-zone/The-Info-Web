[[Hans Mayers]] was a German national who served as the director of [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen Industries]]' chemical plant in [[Paraguay]]. He presented the facility as an "agricultural project" producing insecticide, despite its true nature as a chemical weapons plant.[^1]

In September 1988, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] visited the plant and met [[Hans Mayers|Mayers]], who attempted to conceal the true purpose of the facility. [[Hans Mayers|Mayers]] stated that the product was sent to [[Chile]] and then to [[Iraq]] for agricultural projects, and confirmed [[Ihsan Barbouti|Barbouti's]] involvement as a joint venture partner, with materials sourced from [[Florida]] and [[Texas]].[^1]

[[Hans Mayers|Mayers]] was later identified as one of the 19 individuals eliminated in late 1988 by [[Mossad]] hit squads, composed of unsuspecting Palestinians, as part of an [[Israel|Israeli]] operation to stop the flow of chemical weapons technology to [[Iraq]].[^1]
