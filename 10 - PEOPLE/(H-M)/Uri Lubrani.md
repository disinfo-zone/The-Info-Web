Uri Lubrani was a former Israeli ambassador to [[Iran]]. In 1978, he provided a trenchant analysis to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] predicting that the Shah of Iran would not survive the popular uprising. The [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] had rejected his view, despite their own embarrassingly inept reporting on [[Iran]]. Lubrani was attached to the Israeli delegation that negotiated the March 1979 [[KH-11]] agreement in [[Washington D.C.]].[^1]
