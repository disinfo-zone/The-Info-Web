[[Iran Najd Rankuni]] was the [[Tehran]] contact for the [[Hashemi brothers]]. He was the head of the Dervish movement and a son-in-law of [[Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani|Hojjat El-Islam Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], who was to become president of [[Iran]].[^1]

[[Iran Najd Rankuni|Rankuni]] was connected with the [[Iranian Revolutionary Guards]]. However, he did not have direct access to the Supreme Council, which actually called the shots in [[Iran]], and therefore could not set up a serious dialogue between the [[USA|Americans]] and the [[Iran|Iranians]] for the release of the hostages.[^1]
