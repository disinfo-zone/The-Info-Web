[[H.L. Hunt]] was a prominent Texas oilman, described as being cut from the same political cloth as [[Clint Murchison, Sr.]]. He was a key organizer of the pro-[[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] forces in Texas. Hunt accompanied [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] on a flight to Texas for a speaking tour after MacArthur was relieved of his Korean command by President [[Harry Truman]] in 1951.[^1]

Hunt and [[Clint Murchison, Sr.]] were the chief organizers of the pro-[[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] movement in Texas. Hunt went on to establish a MacArthur-for-president headquarters in Chicago, spending $150,000 of his own money on the general's reluctant 1952 presidential campaign. This campaign eventually faltered as MacArthur adopted the strident rhetoric of the right wing.[^1]
