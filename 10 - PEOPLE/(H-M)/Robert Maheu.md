[[Robert Maheu]] was a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who became a prominent figure in the business and intelligence worlds, notably serving as the CEO of [[Howard Hughes]] operations in Las Vegas. He was also a Senior Vice President and Director of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]].[^1]

Maheu's connections extended to organized crime figures, as he was involved in [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operations to assassinate [[Fidel Castro]] in 1960. In this capacity, he acted as a "cut-out," contacting organized-crime leaders such as [[Sam Giancana]], [[Johnny Rosselli]], and [[Santos Trafficante, Jr.]], who in turn enlisted the direct assistance of Cuban exiles.[^1]

His involvement with [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] placed him among a group of powerful individuals, including [[Michael A. McManus]], [[Robert Booth Nichols]], and [[Clint W. Murchison, Jr.]], who were described as intelligence people working for the [[National Security Council|NSC]]. [^1]
