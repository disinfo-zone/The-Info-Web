Dominic Laiti was the Chairman of [[Hadron]], Inc., a company that became central to [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s allegations of a conspiracy to steal its [[PROMIS]] software.

[[Bill Hamilton]], president of Inslaw, claimed that on April 20, 1983, Laiti telephoned him, stating that Hadron needed the PROMIS software for federal government contracts it expected to receive due to its political contacts, including with [[Edwin Meese]]. Hamilton alleged that Laiti expressed Hadron's intention to become a leading vendor of law enforcement and court software, and that Hadron was seeking to purchase [[INSLAW|Inslaw]]. When Hamilton declined to meet, Laiti allegedly threatened, "We have ways of making you sell."[^1]

Laiti was also involved in a 1983 Hadron fundraising trip to New York, which Hamilton claimed was for the purpose of raising capital to buy PROMIS. Laiti stated that the trip was to raise capital for [[Simeon]], a Hadron subsidiary manufacturing software products for public safety companies, and that the search for capital had nothing to do with acquiring Inslaw or PROMIS. He denied ever discussing the acquisition of PROMIS or Inslaw with [[Paul Wormeli]] or [[Earl Brian]], or mentioning PROMIS or Inslaw at any of the New York meetings. Laiti also denied making any threats to Hamilton about having "ways of making [Hamilton] sell."[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation found that Laiti denied making the statements attributed to him by Hamilton. The investigation concluded that Hamilton's affidavit, to the extent it speculated that Laiti traveled to New York to raise money related to Inslaw or PROMIS, was incorrect. There was no evidence from the interviewed individuals that Hadron or Simeon ever had any interest in obtaining Inslaw's software. The report found Laiti's denials convincing and concluded that there was no credible evidence that Hadron ever tried to acquire Inslaw or PROMIS, except for Hamilton's uncorroborated claims.[^1]
