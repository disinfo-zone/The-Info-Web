Walter Levy was an assistant to [[J. B. Rhine]] at the [[Duke University Parapsychology Laboratory]]. In 1974, he was caught cheating in an experiment involving rats. The experiment was designed to test whether rats could use [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] to increase the number of pleasurable brain stimulations delivered by an apparatus[^1].

Levy's research assistants discovered him tampering with the lab equipment and recorded him on videotape. When confronted with the evidence, Levy confessed and resigned. This scandal became fodder for skeptics of Rhine and his [[Parapsychology|parapsychology]] research[^1].
