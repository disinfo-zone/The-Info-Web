# James Moore

James Moore was a chemist who worked for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] on [[Project MKUltra|MKULTRA Subproject 58]], a classified effort to locate and mass-produce the hallucinogenic mushroom *teonanáctl* (God's flesh) for intelligence use[^1].

Moore was assigned the task of infiltrating East Coast mycology groups, posing as a deep-pocketed professor backed by funding from the Geschickter Fund for Medical Research, a principal funding source for the CIA's brain warfare program. His cover story was that he was interested in natural-product chemistry and wanted to fund private mushroom-hunting expeditions[^1].

In 1956, after two years of unsuccessful efforts, Moore finally persuaded [[R. Gordon Wasson]] to take him along on a mushroom-hunting expedition to Mexico. An official [[Project MKUltra|MKULTRA Subproject 58]] invoice indicated payment "in support of an expedition... for the purpose of studying and collecting hallucinogenic species of mushrooms of interest"[^1].

The mission proved traumatic for Moore, who reportedly got sick and disliked the experience. At one point, he was left roadside in Mexico in the care of local Indians when the group's small airplane had to lighten its load. Despite the difficulties, Moore fulfilled his CIA mandate, returning with *teonanáctl* mushrooms for the Agency to analyze[^1].

However, the CIA's desire to keep the drug a secret psychic weapon was undermined when Wasson published a twelve-page account of his experience in *Life* magazine, highlighting the mushroom's alleged ability to access and enhance [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]]. This article caused a sensation and led to pleasure seekers flocking to Mexico to consume *God's flesh*[^1].
