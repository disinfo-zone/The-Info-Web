[[Arthur Hebard]] is a physicist who, as a Stanford postdoctoral physics student, built a special experimental magnetometer in the basement of Varian Hall at [[Stanford University]]. This magnetometer, funded by the Office of Naval Research, was designed to measure extremely small magnetic field perturbations from passing quarks. Its high sensitivity and heavy shielding made it an ideal challenge for psychic experiments.[^1]

In June 1972, [[Hal Puthoff]] brought [[Ingo Swann]] to Hebard's lab to test Swann's abilities. During this experiment, Swann appeared to affect the magnetometer's output, causing its steady reading to suddenly change. This event, though initially suspected by others as mundane noise, convinced Puthoff of the paranormal occurrence and spurred his further investigation into psi phenomena.[^1]
