Donald A. Myers was a specialist with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] on the biological and health effects of non-ionizing radiation. In July 1975, he was sent to [[Moscow]] to work in secret with [[State Department]] officials regarding the [[Moscow Signal]], a microwave beam aimed at the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] by the [[Soviet Union]][^1].

Myers's deployment came two years after a new and more powerful set of Soviet microwave beams (MUTS-2) were picked up by the [[CIA]] in Moscow. His presence indicated the growing concern within the U.S. government about the potential health hazards posed by these signals to embassy personnel[^1].
