Christian A. Herter served as the Secretary of State under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] from 1959 to 1961. In early December 1960, he was reportedly upset upon being shown a photograph of [[Dimona]] taken from a highway, and called in [[Avraham Harman]], the Israeli ambassador, for an explanation. Herter also conducted his own independent checking, asking an aide to approach the French about their involvement with [[Israel]]'s nuclear program.[^1]

Herter was instructed by the White House to give a formal diplomatic protest (demarche) to the French. He approached [[Maurice Couve de Murville]], the French foreign minister, who assured the [[State Department]] that the Israeli reactor was benign and any plutonium generated would be returned to [[France]] for safekeeping, a statement later revealed to be a lie.[^1]

On January 6, 1961, Herter gave his farewell briefing as secretary of state to a closed session of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, where he discussed the "disturbing" new element in the [[Middle East]] related to [[Dimona]].[^1]
