Colonel [[Pesah Melowany]] was an officer in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defense Forces]]' External Relations Department. He provided a letter of recommendation for [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], confirming Ben-Menashe's service in key positions within the department. The letter highlighted Ben-Menashe's involvement in "complex and sensitive assignments" that demanded "exceptional analytical and executive capabilities," and praised his "proficiency and devotion" and efficient and reliable fulfillment of assignments.[^1]

This letter was later introduced as evidence during [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe's]] trial to counter the [[Israel|Israeli]] government's claim that he was merely a low-level translator.[^1]
