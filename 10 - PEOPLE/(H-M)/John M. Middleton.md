Worked on the team developing the original 1969 [[PROMIS]] under [[Joan E. Jacoby]], [[Charles R. Work]], and [[Bill Hamilton]].
### Possible John M. Middletons

John M. Middleton is a relatively common name. Even with sparse records from the 1960’s through 1980’s, there are several John M. Middletons working with or adjacent to the government or in STEM fields. 

One appears to have worked for the DOE on nuclear projects[^1] in 1959 as part of Division 2543 (unclear what this is). This John was living in Nevada at the time and working at Sandia.

Another worked for the state department (ACTION(R-4)IO) as an International Operations Adviser[^2] (seemingly in the International Organization Affairs Section) in 1972. There was a state dept cable[^5] presumably referring to the same Middelton who was vetted to consult for UNESCO Program 40333.

Another was a LT in the navy as of 1964[^3] (this could be either of the previously mentioned Middleton’s as well). 

One had a patent in 1962[^4]. There may also have been an agricultural engineer Middleton (perhaps with the patent), but the documentation is poor.

There was a John Middleton with a ham radio license living in Virginia in 1990 - call sign KC4LHC. Now living in Bethesda[^6]. Seems to be born in 1947[^7]. This seems like the best bet.
