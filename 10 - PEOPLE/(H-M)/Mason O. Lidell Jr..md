[[Mason O. Lidell Jr.]] was the superintendent of [[Paul Wilcher]]'s building. He provided information regarding the scene after Wilcher's death. Lidell stated that a Lieutenant and a Sergeant from the DC Police, with the help of firemen, entered Wilcher's apartment. They found Wilcher's computer turned on and, after reading what was on the screen, summoned the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].[^1]

After entering the apartment and getting a brief glance at the body and the apartment, Lidell was ordered to leave. The apartment was sealed off for the rest of the day, except for official personnel. The body was removed around 12:30 p.m., though Lidell did not witness this. He noted that when he re-entered the apartment later, there was blood on the floor and commode that was not present earlier, which he was told was due to measures taken to move the body.[^1]

Lidell stated that [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agents arrived around 4:30 p.m., and at least three [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agents entered the apartment between 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. He also claimed that one man appeared and identified himself as [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] (without offering identification) and joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents in the apartment during that time. Lidell also noted that an NBC camera crew was prevented from entering the apartment.[^1]
