[[Raymond Lavas]] was a former associate of [[Ted Gunderson]] and, according to [[Michael Riconosciuto]], a former protégé of [[Robert Maheu]]. He is noted for expressing his professional opinion about the death of [[Alan Michael May]] in a letter. In this letter, Lavas suggested that certain chemical assassination methods could have been employed, which would cause toxins to evaporate from the body, making the death appear natural. He emphasized that unless a body is immediately refrigerated, such toxins quickly evaporate, leaving minimal traces that would be difficult for a forensic expert to detect without prior suspicion.[^1]

Lavas also turned some of [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s disks over to the Jack Brooks investigative committee (House Judiciary Committee on [[INSLAW]]). Riconosciuto claimed there was no data on these disks, as they contained a sub-set of VAX VMS routines modified to activate a one-time pad encryption scheme, requiring specific hardware and instructions to unravel.[^1]
