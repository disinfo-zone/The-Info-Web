Patricia Campbell Hearst is an American newspaper heiress who was kidnapped in 1974 by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA), a radical left-wing organization.[^1]

Her kidnapping became a major news story, and the Berkeley police requested the assistance of [[Pat Price]], a psychic at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI), in the investigation. Price attempted to locate Hearst using remote viewing, but was unsuccessful.[^1]

Hearst was eventually arrested with other SLA members in 1975. She claimed to have been brainwashed by the group and was later pardoned by President Jimmy Carter.[^1]
