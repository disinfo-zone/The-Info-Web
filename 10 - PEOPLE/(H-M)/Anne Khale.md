# Anne Khale

Anne Khale was a [[NASA]] satellite imagery specialist who was hired by [[Stephan Schwartz]] to serve as an unbiased third-party observer for [[Project Deep Quest]]. Her role was to accompany the team and monitor all control elements for fraud during the psychic functioning experiments[^1].

Khale's involvement as an independent observer was crucial for ensuring the credibility of the project, which aimed to use [[Remote Viewing]] to locate a previously unknown shipwreck and to test long-distance remote viewing for the [[U.S. Air Force]][^1].
