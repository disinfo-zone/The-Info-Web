Jens C. Hauge was a Norwegian official who spent two weeks in April 1961 conducting [[Norway]]'s first—and only—inspection of the heavy water that had been sold to [[Israel]]. His inspection, closely monitored by [[Ernst David Bergmann]], found the water safely stored near the Nahal Soreq research reactor, as [[Dimona]] was not yet in operation. Hauge's report to the Norwegian foreign ministry was astonishing in its uncritical acceptance of all of Bergmann's assertions, including that the heavy water would be used to power a twenty-four-megawatt "research reactor" that would be a model for a planned much larger power reactor.[^1]
