[[Jimmy Hoffa]] was a prominent American labor union leader. A lot in Beverly Hills sold by [[Clint Murchison, Sr.]] to [[Richard Nixon]] was financed through a Hoffa loan. [[Meyer Lansky]]'s Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas was also financed through a Hoffa loan.[^1]

[[Clint W. Murchison, Jr.]] attempted to persuade the Senate Rules Committee in 1964 that his real estate dealings with Hoffa in Florida were "hardly relevant" to the [[Bobby Baker]] investigation.[^1]
