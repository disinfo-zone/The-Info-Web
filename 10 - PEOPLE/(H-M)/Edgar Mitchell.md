Edgar Mitchell was an American astronaut, best known as the lunar module pilot for Apollo 14, making him the sixth person to walk on the Moon. Following his NASA career, Mitchell became a prominent advocate for psychic research and consciousness studies, founding the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS).[^1]

Mitchell was a strong believer in psi phenomena and was involved in the early stages of the U.S. government's psychic research programs. He was present during some of [[Uri Geller]]'s tests at [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI), even driving Geller while blindfolded in a demonstration of Geller's alleged abilities.[^1]

He also funded [[Andrija Puharich]]'s efforts to bring Geller to the United States through a grant from his Institute of Noetic Sciences. Mitchell also suggested that [[Ingo Swann]] look for [[Patty Hearst]] using remote viewing, though Swann was ultimately unsuccessful.[^1]

### Advocacy for UAP Disclosure

Dr. Mitchell's interest in the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]] topic stemmed from his childhood growing up in the Roswell, New Mexico, area. He claimed that his family was among those who were threatened by the FBI after the [[Roswell Incident]] in 1947, and that this experience convinced him that the government was covering up the truth about UAP. As an astronaut, he became a prominent and credible voice in the UAP disclosure movement, using his platform to call for greater transparency from the government.[^2]

Dr. Mitchell was a close friend and confidant of [[Harold "Hal" Puthoff]] and [[Eric Davis]]. They gave him a copy of the [[Wilson-Davis Memo]], a document that detailed a conversation with Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson about a secret UAP reverse-engineering program. After Dr. Mitchell's death, the memo was discovered in his files and was leaked to the public. The leak of this document has been a significant event in the UAP disclosure movement, providing a detailed account of the alleged "Legacy Program."[^2]
