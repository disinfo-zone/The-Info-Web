Yitzhak Hofi was the director of [[Mossad]], [[Israel]]'s primary foreign intelligence service. He opposed the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak]] in June 1981, primarily because there was no evidence that [[Iraq]] was yet capable of building a bomb. He was joined in this futile dissent by [[Yehoshua Saguy]], chief of military intelligence, and [[Yigael Yadin]], the deputy prime minister.[^1]

Two weeks after the Osirak bombing, Hofi gave an unprecedented newspaper interview, criticizing politicians who were compromising secret intelligence. This was widely understood within the Israeli intelligence community as a criticism of Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]]'s public remarks about a secret underground facility.[^1]

[[Rafael Eitan]] had a need to settle old scores with [[Yitzhak Hofi]], the head of [[Mossad]], and [[Avraham Shalom]], Shin Beth's director. This personal ambition and need for revenge drove Eitan's actions, including the recruitment of [[Jonathan Pollard]].[^2]
