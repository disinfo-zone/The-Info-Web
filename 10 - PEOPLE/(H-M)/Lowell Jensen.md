D. Lowell Jensen served as Deputy Attorney General of the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. He became a figure in the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] due to allegations made by [[Inslaw Corporation]] and findings by Bankruptcy Judge Bason. Further, his secretary brought a letter to [[William Bradford Reynolds]] for signature because Jensen was out of the building, the letter needed to be sent that day, and it needed to be signed by someone in [[Edwin Meese]]'s inner circle. This letter advised that the [[PROMIS]] software was being provided to an Arab Sheik for resale and general distribution.[^1]

[[Edwin Meese]] reportedly recused himself on [[PROMIS]] when he became [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in February 1985, and Jensen therefore had to handle [[PROMIS]].[^1]

Inslaw alleged that Jensen had a "previously developed negative attitude about [[PROMIS]] and [[INSLAW]]" and that he consciously ignored Inslaw's complaints about [[C. Madison Brewer]]. Inslaw further alleged that Jensen, through various subordinates, was induced by [[Earl Brian]]'s political influence to engineer disputes with Inslaw, eventually driving the company into bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Judge Bason, in his findings, concluded that Jensen's "biased attitude toward Inslaw contributed to the situation in which Inslaw's complaints about Brewer and the administration of the PROMIS implementation contract went unheeded."[^2]

However, the investigation by Special Counsel [[Nicholas J. Bua]] found no credible evidence to support these allegations. Judge Jensen, who later became a federal district judge, denied engineering any contract disputes with Inslaw or directing any DOJ action to harm Inslaw. He also denied any financial interest in companies controlled by Brian (such as [[Biotech]], [[Hadron]], [[Accumenics]], and [[Simeon]]) or ever being promised stock in any computer-related company. He stated that he was sincerely interested in modernizing DOJ operations through computer technology, recalling "[[Project Eagle]]," a multi-million dollar project to automate DOJ's litigating divisions, but denied involvement in awarding contracts for it, noting that the Request For Proposals (RFP) for the project was issued in May 1986, and he was appointed to the bench the following June.[^2]
