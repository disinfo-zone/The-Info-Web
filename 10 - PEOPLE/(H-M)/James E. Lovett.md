James E. Lovett was a senior [[Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] scientist. He was hired by [[Zalman Mordecai Shapiro]] in a desperate effort to save his company, [[Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation|NUMEC]], by taking over nuclear materials accountability. Lovett insisted that the concrete floor of the old plant be protected with stainless steel, as concrete absorbed far more uranium than suspected. He realized that Shapiro and other company officials were deluding themselves about recovering most of the missing uranium from NUMEC's waste pits, as much of it was embedded in the concrete floor, clinging to ventilation ducts, or flushed into local waterways.[^1]
