Arthur Krock was a prominent Washington columnist for the *New York Times*. In December 1960, he served as an intermediary, directing [[John W. Finney]] to [[John A. McCone]], then chairman of the [[Atomic Energy Commission]], to get a story about [[Israel]]'s secret nuclear reactor at [[Dimona]]. Krock's role indicated that the administration was looking to plant the story publicly.[^1]
