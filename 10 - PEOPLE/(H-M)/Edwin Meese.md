[[Edwin Meese]] was an associate of [[Earl Brian]] and served as [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] during the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration. He is linked to the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] and the alleged efforts to sell stolen software for covert government operations.[^1]

[[William Bradford Reynolds]], Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division, stated that [[Lowell Jensen]]'s secretary brought a letter to him for signature because Jensen was out of the building, the letter needed to be sent that day, and it needed to be signed by someone in Edwin Meese's inner circle. Reynolds signed the letter, which advised that the [[PROMIS]] software was being provided to an Arab Sheik for resale and general distribution. Reynolds also had a vague recollection that Meese recused himself on [[PROMIS]] when he became [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in February 1985, and Jensen therefore had to handle [[PROMIS]].[^1]
