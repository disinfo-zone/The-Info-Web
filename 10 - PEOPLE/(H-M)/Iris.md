[[Iris]] was a representative of [[LAKAM]] in [[Washington D.C.]]. She served as a conduit for intelligence reports between [[Robert McFarlane]] and [[Jonathan Pollard]] in the [[USA|U.S.]], and [[Rafi Eitan]] in [[Israel]].[^1]

[[Iris]] would receive requests for computer access codes for certain intelligence items from [[Rafi Eitan|Eitan]]. She would then pass these requests to [[Robert McFarlane|McFarlane]], who would provide her with the specified access codes. [[Iris]] would then give these codes to [[Jonathan Pollard|Pollard]], who would retrieve the information, photocopy it, and return the copies to [[Iris]]. This process was designed to distance [[Robert McFarlane|McFarlane]] from [[Jonathan Pollard|Pollard]].[^1]
