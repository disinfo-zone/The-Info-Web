[[Ed Hardy]] was the president of [[Curry Company]], the largest concessionaire in Yosemite National Park. He was closely associated with Mariposa County officials, including Mariposa District Attorney [[Bruce Eckerson]], County Assessor [[Steve Dunbar]], and Congressman [[Tony Coelho]]. Hardy and these officials were known for their annual camping trips together, and Hardy was a regular fixture at social events in Mariposa. The local townsfolk encouraged these connections, as much of Mariposa's tax base came from Curry Company.[^1]
