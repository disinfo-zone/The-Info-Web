Samuel W. Lewis was the U.S. ambassador to [[Israel]], assigned in 1977. He was present at a meeting in the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] White House in September 1981 where [[Menachem Begin]] and [[Ariel Sharon]] presented a far-reaching agenda for U.S.â€“Israeli strategic cooperation. Lewis recounted that Begin suggested a formal alliance, and Reagan agreed, shocking others present. Sharon then outlined a plan that included joint use of airfields and Navy ports, and shared intelligence, including formal Israeli access to the [[KH-11]] satellite for its nuclear targeting of the [[Soviet Union]].[^1]
