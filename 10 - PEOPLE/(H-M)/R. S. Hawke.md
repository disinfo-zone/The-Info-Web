R. S. Hawke was one of the scientists at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] who conducted classified [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]] tests with [[Uri Geller]] in the winter of 1975. These tests aimed to determine if Geller could interfere with high-quality lasers and affect magnetic computer program cards[^1].

Hawke documented the results of one of these tests, stating that "The magnetic pattern stored in the iron oxide layer of a magnetic program card was erased." He concluded that "Further experiments are warranted," indicating a measurable effect from Geller's alleged abilities[^1].
