Gerald Lewis was the [[Florida]] state comptroller who refused to renew [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]]'s license to operate in the state after the 1990 Tampa money-laundering conviction.[^1]
### Role in BCCI Regulation

Lewis's decision to shut down BCCI's operations in Florida was a direct response to the bank's money-laundering conviction. He received letters from [[Charles Saphos]], Chief of the Criminal Division Narcotics section of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], requesting that BCCI be allowed to remain open.[^2] Lewis, however, maintained that the bank had to comply with all legal requirements, including those related to felony convictions.[^3]

Lewis's actions ultimately led to the closure of BCCI's branches in Florida.[^4]
