[[Ken Mattheys]] was the newly elected Sheriff of Mariposa County who responded to [[Leslie Van Meter]]'s Citizen's Complaint by re-opening the investigation into her husband [[Ron Van Meter]]'s disappearance. He appointed deputies [[Frank McCoy]] and [[Lonnie Hammond]] to handle the internal affairs aspect.[^1]

In October 1984, Mattheys recruited private investigator [[Raymond Jenkins]] and retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Tom Walsh]] from Merced to investigate Van Meter's disappearance and help him clean up the Sheriff's Department. These investigators subsequently concluded that [[Ron Van Meter]] was murdered after obtaining evidence of drug trafficking within the department.[^1]

Shortly after a meeting with [[Leslie Van Meter]] at Lake McClure, Mattheys mysteriously resigned from his position. He later revealed to reporter Anthony Pirushki that he had been ordered by two county supervisors and the county's attorney "to stay away from the Van Meter investigation." While still in office, Mattheys and his internal affairs investigators learned that [[Ron Van Meter]] had reported drug dealing and corruption within the Mariposa Sheriff's Department to the [[California Attorney General's Office|Attorney General's office]] in Sacramento shortly before his death.[^1]
