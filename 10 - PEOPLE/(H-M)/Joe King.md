[[Joe King]] was a [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]] agent working out of the strategic unit based in the [[World Trade Center]] in [[Manhattan]]. He was involved in the [[Hashemi sting]] operation, which was designed to entrap individuals connected with [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence arms sales to [[Iran]].[^1]

[[Joe King|King]] and his partner, Romeo, contacted [[Cyrus Hashemi]] and contrived an illegal frame-up. [[Cyrus Hashemi|Hashemi]] was to be the bait and the trap, allowing his phone to be tapped and himself to be wired. [[Joe King|King]] was also present at [[Cyrus Hashemi|Hashemi's]] [[London]] apartment shortly before [[Cyrus Hashemi|Hashemi]] was found dead, a death attributed to a sudden case of virulent leukemia, though [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence suspected foul play.[^1]
