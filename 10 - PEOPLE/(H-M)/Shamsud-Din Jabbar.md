Shamsud-Din Jabbar ([[act of terrorism|terrorist]]) was 42 when he died while performing the [[New Orleans Truck Attack]]. He was born in Beaumont, Texas[^2] and raised Muslim, but strayed and only recently returned. His last address was in Houston.[^1]

Jabbar was a [[U.S. Army]] veteran (joined in 2007) and worked in human resources and IT. He deployed to [[Afghanistan War|Afghanistan]] from February 2009 to January 2010 (possibly 2015) and was stationed at [[Fort Bragg]] at one point. In 2015 he was discharged and attended [[Georgia State University]] where he graduated in 2017 with a degree in computer information systems. Prior to GSU, he attended Central Texas College from 2008-2010 and received an associate degree in Information technology.

In 2021 Jabbar was hired by [[Deloitte]] where he worked as a data engineer, then cloud data architect, and finally in business development. He’s also reported to have worked for [[Ernst & Young]] at some point. He held a real estate license that expired in 2023 and was Team Lead for the Midas Group and Property Manager at Blue Meadow Properties (his phone number at the time was 832-774-9718)[^2].

He held a number of LLC’s in Texas and Georgia including Blue Meadow Properties LLC (2017 Fresno, TX), Digital Drip, LLC (Jun 13 2019-Oct 22 2020, dissolved, founded with [[Ishak Yusuf]][^6] in Clarkston, GA), Gens Enterprises, LLC (Dec 10 2015-Sep 7 2018 Clarkston, GA), and Jabbar Real Estate Holdings LLC (2020 Fresno, TX)[^5]

Jabbar was married three times and had children from two relationships. His first marriage ended in 2012, the second was from 2013-2016, the third was 2017-2022[^4]. The most recent divorce suggested financial difficulties with monthly childhood support exceeding his income. A restraining order was filed against him by his third wife.

He had a minor criminal record including traffic offences (DWI)[^3] and theft.

The FBI seized three mobile phones and two laptops. Jabbar uploaded a number of videos to Facebook in the hours preceding the attack. The videos allegedly claim he joined IS earlier in the year and contained a will and testament.
