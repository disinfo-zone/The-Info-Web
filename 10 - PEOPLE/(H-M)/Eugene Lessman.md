Eugene “Gene” Alden Lessman was an important recruiter for “spooky” work for the [[U.S. Army]] according to [[Luis Elizondo]] in his 2024 book, *Imminent*. Lessman was also known as John James Kielty[^2] and passed away in 2019. He, like his father before him, spent much of his career in military intelligence.

Gene served three tours in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] (Dec 1966 - 1973[^5]) and was part of the [[Special Operations Group]] (SOG) and a [[Green Beret]] partaking in ops such as [[Project Phoenix]].[^1]

Following his tours in Vietnam for which he received a Purple Heart, Bronze Star, and Air Medal with Valor, Gene was posted in Berlin where he ran counter intelligence operations[^3].

Eventually Gene retired after 20 years in the army and he then spent 20 years in civil service.[^4]

Gene allegedly recruited Lue Elizondo to the [[Great Skill Program]] to practice [[Remote Viewing]]. Lue claims “Great Skill[s]” [sic] was also called “Grey Fox” according to Gene, but that seems to be a different program (and actually spelled [[GRAY FOX]]) within the [[United States Army Intelligence Support Activity]] (USAISA or ISA) under the [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC).

Lue further claims that Gene was tasked with recruiting soldiers into [[STARGATE PROJECT]].

Starting in November 1986, Lessman took turns monitoring [[Angela Dellafiora]], one of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]'s most effective remote viewers. He attempted to curtail Dellafiora's "occult habits," such as her voice quivering and body shaking during sessions, by implementing a new protocol where he would command "refocus" to get her to regain control[^6].

In one notable session, Lessman tasked Dellafiora with remotely viewing the [[Stanford Dish]]. Despite his attempts to control her, Dellafiora quickly and accurately described the target, demonstrating her exceptional abilities. Lessman's official logs reveal his awe at her performance, noting her speed and the specificity of her details[^6].
