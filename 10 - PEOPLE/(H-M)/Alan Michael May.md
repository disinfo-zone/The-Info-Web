[[Alan Michael May]] was a former Northern California field director in [[Richard Nixon]]'s presidential campaign and an attorney for Nixon's brothers, Donald and Edward. He was found dead in his San Francisco home on June 19, 1991, four days after a newspaper story in the *Napa Sentinel* outlined his alleged role in a plot by Republican Party officials to bribe Iranian officials to delay the release of U.S. hostages until after President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration.[^1]

[[Raymond Lavas]], a former associate of [[Ted Gunderson]] and a former protégé of [[Robert Maheu]], expressed his professional opinion about May's death in a letter. He suggested that certain chemical assassination methods could have been used, which would evaporate from the body, making the cause of death appear natural. He noted that unless the body is immediately refrigerated, toxins quickly evaporate, leaving minimal traces that a trained forensic expert might not detect unless suspicious circumstances are already present.[^1]
