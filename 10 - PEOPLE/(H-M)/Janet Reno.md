[[Janet Reno]] served as the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] of the [[United States]]. She is included here in connection with the death of [[Paul Wilcher]], a Washington D.C. attorney who had been investigating the [[October Surprise]] incident and the [[INSLAW]] case. Wilcher hand-delivered a 100-page letter to Reno on May 21, 1993, claiming that holdover [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] employees from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-[[George Bush|Bush]] era were responsible for government cover-ups.[^1]

Wilcher was interviewed by [[Carl Stern]], Reno's public relations man, regarding the contents of the letter. After Wilcher's death, [[Sarah McClendon]] and [[Garby Leon]] wrote letters to Reno, urging her to investigate Wilcher's death due to its disturbing parallels with [[Danny Casolaro]]'s death and the implications for individual investigation and criticism of government activities.[^1]

[[Bill Hamilton]] also mentioned that a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] report commissioned by [[Janet Reno]] confirmed that a system called [[PROMIS]] was being used by [[Canada|Canadian]] agencies, but claimed it was totally different from [[INSLAW]]'s [[PROMIS]] software.[^1]
