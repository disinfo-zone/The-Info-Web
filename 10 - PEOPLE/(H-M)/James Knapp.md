James Knapp was a non-career Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. He was implicated in allegations surrounding the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]].

According to a source of [[Ronald LeGrand]], Knapp was one of three senior DOJ officials, along with [[Miles Matthews]] and [[James Johnston]], whom [[Lowell Jensen]] allegedly relied upon to engineer [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s problems. The source claimed that Jensen wanted to get Inslaw "out of the way and give the business to friends."[^1]

However, when interviewed by the Special Counsel, James Knapp stated that he was unaware of any negative feelings toward Inslaw by Jensen. He denied any knowledge of, or participation in, a scheme to cause problems for [[INSLAW]] or to give Inslaw's contracts to friends of Jensen or [[Edwin Meese]]. Knapp also stated that he did not even know James Johnston, who was alleged to have conspired with him to implement Jensen's scheme. The Special Counsel's investigation found no credible evidence to support the allegations against Knapp or any connection between him and a conspiracy related to Inslaw or [[PROMIS]].[^1]
