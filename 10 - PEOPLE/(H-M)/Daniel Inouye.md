[[Daniel Inouye]] was a United States Senator from Hawaii who, along with Senators [[Harry Reid]] and [[Ted Stevens]], was instrumental in securing the initial funding for the [[Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program]] (AAWSAP), the precursor to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP).[^1]

### Role in Funding AATIP

As a highly respected and influential senator, and a decorated World War II veteran who had lost an arm in combat, Inouye was a key member of the bipartisan trio that controlled congressional spending for "black budget" programs within the [[Pentagon]]. His support was crucial in securing the $22 million appropriation that established AAWSAP in 2007. His involvement, along with that of his colleagues, ensured that the program had the necessary resources to begin its investigation into the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]] issue.[^1]
