Marilyn Jacobs was the secretary to [[Lowell Jensen]] at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. She continued to work for Judge Jensen after he moved to San Francisco in 1986 following his appointment to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

[[Bill Hamilton]]'s affidavit alleged that Jacobs told an anonymous informant that Judge Jensen "was the main person behind the [[Inslaw Corporation|INSLAW]] problem" and that "his style was to operate using his subordinates." However, Jacobs stated that the information contained in Hamilton's affidavit was false. She denied ever telling anyone anything about [[INSLAW]] while she was at the Department, or that Jensen was the main person behind the Inslaw problem, or anything to that effect. She also denied ever telling anyone that Jensen's style was to operate using his subordinates. To her knowledge, Judge Jensen was not involved in any wrongdoing with regard to Inslaw. The Special Counsel's investigation acknowledged that Jacobs' credibility might be viewed in light of her continued employment with Judge Jensen, but given the failure of Hamilton's supposed source to come forward and the lack of other evidence linking Judge Jensen to any Inslaw-related conspiracy, her denial was found credible.[^1]
