[[Khatoun]] is the mother of [[Ari Ben-Menashe]]. She was an affluent Iraqi Jew who married [[Gourdji]] in [[Baghdad]] in 1945 and settled in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]]. In late 1950 and early 1951, she visited [[Israel]] with her husband to explore the possibility of moving there.[^1]

In July 1966, [[Khatoun]] took [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ari]] and his sisters, Claris, Evon, and Stella, to [[Israel]], where Stella and [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ari]] were enrolled at the American International School in Kfar Smaryahu. Five years later, [[Khatoun]] and her husband moved from [[Tehran]] to [[Israel]].[^1]

During [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ari's]] imprisonment, [[Khatoun]] was the only family member who did not abandon him, despite being hassled and threatened by the [[Israel|Israeli]] government.[^1]
