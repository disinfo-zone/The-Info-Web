Carl Kaysen is a distinguished political economist who served as deputy assistant to the President for national security affairs. He moved from the Harvard faculty to the [[National Security Council]] in 1961. Kaysen recalled that President [[John F. Kennedy]] was intellectually and emotionally committed to a halt in the spread of nuclear weapons, and that nonproliferation was a topic Kennedy would discuss for hours.[^1]

In the fall of 1966, Kaysen became the newly appointed director of the prestigious Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton. He learned that [[Lewis L. Strauss]] had used his influence to get [[Ernst David Bergmann]] a two-month appointment as a visiting fellow there. Kaysen was surprised to learn that Strauss, despite his public stance against nuclear proliferation, was privately in favor of a nuclear-armed [[Israel]].[^1]
