[[Barbara Honegger]] was a former [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] [[White House]] aide and author of the book *October Surprise*. In her book, she alleged that [[Monzer Al-Kassar]]'s heroin smuggling network in [[Italy]] was used to launder [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] arms stocks for diversion to [[Iran]]. This was purportedly done with the help of corrupt Italian intelligence officials linked to the secretive fascist Masonic lodge, [[P2]].[^1]
