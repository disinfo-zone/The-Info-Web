Terry D. Miller was the President of Government Sales Consultants, Inc. He became involved in the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] when he alleged that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s Field Office Information Management System ([[FOIMS]]) was a pirated version of [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s [[PROMIS]] software.

In January 1991, Miller sent a letter to FBI Director [[William Sessions]], stating his belief that FOIMS was stolen. He urged the Director to investigate. [[INSLAW]] used this letter to support its motion to reopen discovery in the Bankruptcy Court, arguing that the FBI's response (which did not outright reject the charge) implied an admission that FOIMS was stolen and was, in fact, PROMIS. However, Miller later stated that he did not know whether FOIMS contained stolen software and acknowledged that he based his allegations on claims made by others. The Special Counsel's investigation found no credible evidence to support Miller's allegations, concluding that FOIMS was developed independently by the FBI and was not derived from PROMIS.[^1]
