Walter W. Jenkins was President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s most trusted personal aide. He was involved in handling cash supplied by [[Abraham Feinberg]] for political purposes. In October 1964, Jenkins was arrested on homosexual solicitation charges, which became public three weeks before the 1964 presidential election. This incident led Johnson to order [[Myer Feldman]] and [[Bill Moyers]] to clean out Jenkins's safe, where they found a private cache of money, including funds from Feinberg.[^1]
