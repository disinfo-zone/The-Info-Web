Mordecai Hod was the chief of staff of the Israeli Air Force. He, along with [[Yitzhak Rabin]], went to see [[Abraham Feinberg]] to express their agitation that [[Clark Clifford]] was insisting on [[Israel]] signing the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty|NPT]] as a condition for receiving F-4 fighter jets. Feinberg then intervened to ensure the F-4 sale proceeded without this condition.[^1]
