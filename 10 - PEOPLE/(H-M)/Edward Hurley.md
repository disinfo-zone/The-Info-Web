Edward Hurley was a Vice President at [[Hadron]], Inc., in charge of its criminal justice systems work.

[[Bill Hamilton]]'s affidavit alleged that in June 1985, Hurley told [[Theresa Bousquin]] that he did not believe [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] would survive a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and that Hadron wanted to acquire [[INSLAW|Inslaw]]'s "court software" to complement its law enforcement software. Hamilton also noted that Hurley resigned from Hadron in August 1985, the month after the U.S. Bankruptcy Court issued a confidentiality order sealing Inslaw's proprietary and customer information from the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], and that Hadron divested itself of its law enforcement software in the fall of 1985.[^1]

Theresa Bousquin, a current [as of the time of the report] Inslaw employee, confirmed that she interviewed with Hurley in 1985. She mentioned to Hurley that she was offered a position at Inslaw, and Hurley responded that he also doubted Inslaw could survive bankruptcy. According to Bousquin, Hurley told her that Inslaw was the only real vendor for court systems and had good technology. Bousquin stated that Hurley added words to the effect of "it would be nice to get one's hands on that software." However, Bousquin did not identify any statements Hurley made about any active effort by Hadron to acquire Inslaw, and it was her impression that his remark about the software was made in passing conversation.[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Hamilton's affidavit proved inaccurate regarding Hurley's statements. The investigation found that nothing about Bousquin's statement suggested an effort by Hadron to acquire Inslaw or [[PROMIS]], and that Hurley's remarks were not indicative of a conspiracy.[^1]
