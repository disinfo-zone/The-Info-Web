[[Mary Quick]] was a 63-year-old school teacher and president of the Woman's Auxiliary at Fresno's American Legion Post 509. She was shot in the face and her purse stolen on January 14, 1982. Her death, along with that of [[Paul Morasca]], was traced to looted [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] money from the Sydney-based [[Nugan Hand Bank]].[^1]

Her nephew, [[Brian Weiss]], who had been living at her house in Fresno, was a business associate of [[Michael Riconosciuto]]. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] had told [[Paul Morasca]] that he had given Mary Quick a card containing secret bank account code numbers, believing she could be trusted due to her lack of connection to any of the principals. She was instructed to give the code numbers over the phone only to [[Paul Morasca]] or [[Michael Riconosciuto]].[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] later admitted that he had not, in fact, given any cards to Mary Quick, but had kept them hidden. However, Morasca believed, and under torture revealed, that one of the cards was being held by Mary Quick and the rest were stored in a safe deposit box. Mary Quick died three days later. The computer cards that Morasca and Mary Quick allegedly died for belonged to the Tyme Shares on-line financial clearing house.[^1]
