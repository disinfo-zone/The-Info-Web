Sybil Leek, known as "Britain's most famous witch," was an astrologer and author who was reportedly recruited by [[British Intelligence]] during [[World War II]]. She was involved in a black propaganda effort, where she provided phony horoscopes for the Germans who believed in astrology[^1]. Her work allegedly included writing a chart that convinced [[Rudolf Hess]], the Deputy Führer of [[Nazi Germany]], to fly to England, leading to his capture[^1]. Her son, Julian Leek, confirmed that the details of her involvement in the Hess affair remained officially classified[^1].

After the war, Leek moved to America in 1962. She was later quoted in a classified [[Department of Defense]] monograph on [[Extrasensory Perception]] (ESP), which suggested she became an American intelligence asset[^1].

In the 1970s, [[John LaMothe]]'s report, *Controlled Offensive Behavior—USSR*, identified Sybil Leek as a "noted astrologer and author." She warned that "there is a great danger that within the next ten years the Soviets will be able to steal our top secrets by using out-of-the-body spies"[^1]. Leek also advised the [[CIA]] on witchcraft and the supernatural[^1]. While her sources were sometimes considered biased in favor of ESP research programs, her insights were noted within the intelligence community[^1].
