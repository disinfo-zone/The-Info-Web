Brian D. Josephson is a British theoretical physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1973 for his prediction of the Josephson effect. He is also a vocal proponent of [[Extrasensory Perception|extrasensory perception]] (ESP) and has shown interest in [[Parapsychology|parapsychology]][^1].

His work on the Josephson junction, a configuration of two layers of superconducting material sandwiching a thin layer of non-superconducting material, was part of the quark detector used in [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Ingo Swann]]'s [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]] experiment at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. The design of this device was never made public, making it impossible for anyone to have preexisting knowledge of its appearance[^1].
