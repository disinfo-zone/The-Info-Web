[[Dr. James Lacatski]], known as Jim, is a rocket scientist with a doctorate in engineering who is known for his role as the leader of the [[Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program]] (AAWSAP), the precursor to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP).[^1]

### Leadership of AAWSAP/AATIP

In early 2009, Dr. Lacatski was leading a highly classified program at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) focused on investigating [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP). The program, AAWSAP, operated with authority from Congress and was funded through the efforts of Senators [[Harry Reid]], [[Ted Stevens]], and [[Daniel Inouye]].[^1]

Dr. Lacatski was responsible for recruiting [[Luis Elizondo]] into the program to handle counterintelligence and security. During their first meeting, he directly asked Elizondo for his views on UFOs and explained that the program investigated unidentified aircraft that displayed beyond-next-generation technology and capabilities that did not conform to the known laws of physics.[^1]

Under his leadership, AAWSAP investigated a wide range of UAP-related phenomena, including the incidents at [[Skinwalker Ranch]] and the [[Colares Incidents]] in Brazil. He also commissioned 38 Defense Intelligence Research Documents (DIRDs) on advanced aerospace topics from the program's chief scientist, [[Hal Puthoff]].[^1]

### Challenges and Opposition

Dr. Lacatski's program faced significant opposition from within the [[Pentagon]]. As new leadership took over at the DIA, the program came under increasing scrutiny. Detractors questioned the program's focus on paranormal and theological aspects of the UAP phenomenon, which Dr. Lacatski believed were inextricably linked to the core mystery. He was eventually pressured to stop his efforts and faced a bureaucratic onslaught that sought to dismantle the program.[^1]

Despite his efforts to defend the program and its scientific merits, the internal resistance, including from a group [[Luis Elizondo]] refers to as the "Collins Elite," ultimately led to the program losing its official support and funding. This forced Elizondo to absorb the remnants of AATIP into his own portfolio of national programs to ensure its survival.[^1]
