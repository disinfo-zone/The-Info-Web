Henry K. Beecher (1904–1976) was a controversial anesthesiologist who, for the [[CIA]] in the 1950s, studied the [[Placebo Effect]]. The placebo effect is a remarkable phenomenon whereby a harmless pill or simulated treatment produces real-world physiological effects in humans[^1].

Beecher's work contributed to the understanding of how perception of an event or a situation—real or imagined, rational or irrational—can cause consequential actions to occur. This concept is also related to the [[Thomas Theorem]], which states that "if men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences"[^1].
