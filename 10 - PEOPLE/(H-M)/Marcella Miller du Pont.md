Marcella Miller du Pont was an heiress to the [[du Pont]] chemical and weapons production conglomerate and a passionate supporter of [[ESP]] research. She was a key financial backer of [[Andrija Puharich]]'s [[Round Table Foundation]] and held the honorary title of "mother of magic" within the organization.[^1]

According to documents from the Library of Congress, it was du Pont who first brought the Round Table Foundation to the attention of top-tier government officials, including Admiral John E. Gingrich, the director of security and intelligence for the Atomic Energy Commission.[^1]
