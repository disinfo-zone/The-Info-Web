Myron B. Kratzer was the director of international affairs for the [[Atomic Energy Commission|AEC]] in December 1960. He recalled being telephoned a few hours before [[John A. McCone]]'s farewell appearance on *Meet the Press* by a [[State Department]] colleague, who urged him to ask McCone to downplay the Israeli nuclear issue. McCone, however, refused, stating he would not "tell anything less than the truth."[^1]
