# Don Keach

Don Keach was a renowned deep-sea explorer and former naval officer. He is famous for his role as the submarine pilot who, in 1966, located a lost hydrogen bomb lying on the ocean floor off the coast of Palomares, Spain, after it was jettisoned from a B-52 bomber during a midair collision[^1].

In the fall of 1976, Keach, along with fellow deep-sea explorer [[Don Walsh]], was running the Institute for Marine and Coastal Studies at the [[University of Southern California]]. During a discussion with [[Stephan Schwartz]], a former naval officer interested in psychic research, Keach and Walsh found themselves in a position to assist Schwartz with an ambitious experiment[^1].

They were able to provide Schwartz with rare access to the *Taurus I*, a state-of-the-art, five-man submersible, for three days of sea trials. This opportunity was crucial for Schwartz's [[Project Deep Quest]], which aimed to use [[Remote Viewing]] to locate a previously unknown shipwreck on the seafloor. Keach's involvement facilitated the use of the submersible for this unique psychic functioning experiment[^1].
