[[Marvin Rudnick]] was a [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] who supervised the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretap investigation of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. He, along with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Thomas Gates]] and [[Richard Stavin]] of the Organized Crime Strike Force, believed that [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] had been penetrated by organized crime, based on the wiretaps.[1]

Rudnick subsequently lost his job when he refused to drop the investigation into [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. The wiretaps were later sealed by the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], and no prosecutions were pursued. The Los Angeles Organized Crime Strike Force was disbanded, and Rudnick's efforts to expose the alleged organized crime penetration of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] were thwarted.[1]

After losing his job, Rudnick eventually had part of his story told in the 1993 book, *Stiffed: A True Story of MCA, The Music Business, and the Mafia* by William Knoedelseder.[1]
