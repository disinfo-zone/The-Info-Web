# Karen Jansen

Karen Jansen was a [[United Nations]] inspector and a [[U.S. Army]] major. She was involved in the effort to find [[Saddam Hussein]]'s weapon sites in [[Iraq]] and reportedly worked with [[PSI Tech]], a private firm specializing in [[Remote Viewing]][^1].

According to an Associated Press story by [[Ruth Sinai]], Jansen carried sketches of two sites where the Iraqi leader had supposedly stashed biological weapons. These sketches were provided by PSI Tech president [[Ed Dames]], who claimed they were generated through remote viewing[^1].
