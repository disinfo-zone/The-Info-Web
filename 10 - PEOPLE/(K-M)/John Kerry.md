John Kerry is a former Democratic Senator from [[Massachusetts]] and was chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations.[^1]

### Role in BCCI Investigation

Kerry's subcommittee spearheaded probes of drug trafficking and money laundering, which veered into [[Manuel Noriega]]'s financial dealings.[^2] He proposed a serious investigation of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], but his efforts were initially brushed aside, leading him to believe there was a high-level cover-up.[^3]

He was a key figure in pushing for investigations into BCCI's activities, despite resistance from government agencies. Kerry's subcommittee issued subpoenas for BCCI records and investigated the bank's secret ownership of [[First American Bank]].[^4] He also questioned [[Richard J. Kerr]], Acting [[CIA]] Director, about the agency's knowledge of BCCI's operations.[^5]

Kerry received money from [[Clark Clifford]] and [[Robert Altman]], members of their law firm, during the same month that [[Jack Blum]]'s contract with his subcommittee was terminated.[^6] He introduced a bill that would allow the government to revoke the license of any bank whose officials had been convicted of money laundering, known as the "death penalty bill," which was opposed by BCCI's lawyers.[^7]
