Robert Kennedy was an American politician who served as Attorney General during his brother [[John F. Kennedy]]'s presidency. In an interview published in 1988 by the [[John F. Kennedy Library]], he expressed a cynical view of [[Myer Feldman]], noting that while his older brother valued Feldman's work, Feldman's major interest was [[Israel]] rather than the [[United States]].[^1]
