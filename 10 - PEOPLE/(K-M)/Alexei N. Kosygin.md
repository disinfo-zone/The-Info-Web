Alexei N. Kosygin was the Premier of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1964 to 1980. In mid-October 1973, during the [[Yom Kippur War]], Kosygin flew to [[Cairo]] and persuaded [[Anwar Sadat]] to call for a cease-fire. This occurred after the Israeli military had successfully counterattacked in the [[Golan Heights]] and the [[Sinai]], ending any immediate threat and the necessity for the nuclear alert.[^1]
