Spurgeon M. Keeny, Jr. was the deputy director of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency|ACDA]]. He was a senior bureaucrat involved in high-level scientific issues since the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration. Keeny realized that he and his colleagues needed to "buy some time" after a [[VELA Satellite]] recorded probable evidence of a nuclear explosion on September 22, 1979. He was troubled by the intelligence community's assurance that its assessment was 90 percent accurate, believing that middle-level bureaucrats could not know all the facts. Keeny claimed it was his idea to set up an outside panel to study the VELA data and ensure the satellite had not made an error with enormous political consequences.[^1]
