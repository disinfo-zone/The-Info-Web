Richard J. Kerr served as Acting [[Central Intelligence Agency]] Director. In 1991, he confirmed that the agency had used [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] to move money around the world.[^1]

### Role in BCCI Affair

Kerr appeared before Senator [[John Kerry]]'s Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations on October 25, 1992, to discuss the CIA's knowledge of BCCI's activities.[^2] He stated that the CIA had not been involved with a BCCI "black network" of thugs and assassins, nor had it used BCCI for arms sales to [[Iran]] or diversion of funds for the [[Nicaraguan Contras]].[^3] He also denied that the CIA had a relationship with [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] or had placed him on a watch list.[^4]

Despite these denials, Kerr admitted that the CIA did maintain accounts with BCCI, describing them as normal operational accounts.[^5] The Kerry subcommittee's report suggested that [[William Casey]]'s actions, including any role in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], were undertaken in his position as an adviser to the President, rather than as Director of the CIA, allowing them to be undocumented and deniable.[^6]
