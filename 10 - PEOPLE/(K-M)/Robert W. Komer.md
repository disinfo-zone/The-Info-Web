Robert W. Komer was a staff member of the [[National Security Council]] during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration. He recalled the tension within the White House staff regarding [[Myer Feldman]]'s involvement in Israeli issues, stating that [[McGeorge Bundy]] had a standing rule not to send anything to Feldman because Feldman was getting involved in issues where he had no business. Komer noted that it was hard to tell the difference between what Feldman said and what the Israeli ambassador said.[^1]
