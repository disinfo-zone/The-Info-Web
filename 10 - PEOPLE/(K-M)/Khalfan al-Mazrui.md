Khalfan al-Mazrui was the Head of the [[Karachi]] office of [[Zayed bin Sultan AL-Nahayan|Sheikh Zayed]]'s Private Department.[^1] He was also the brother-in-law of [[Sami Masri]].[^2]

### Role in BCCI Operations

Al-Mazrui was involved in the restructuring efforts of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] after its financial difficulties.[^3] He was part of the group of BCCI bankers around Crown Prince Khalifa who believed they could maintain control of the imploding bank.[^4]

He was responsible for cleaning up the missing hundreds of millions of dollars that were drained off by employees in Karachi, and was sent in to manage the Private Department's Karachi section.[^5]

### Connections and Interactions

Al-Mazrui was in communication with [[Jonathan Beaty]] regarding Sami Masri and the BCCI investigation.[^6] He was cautious and wary, especially about discussing sensitive information over the phone.[^7] He was also involved in meetings with BCCI heads in [[London]].[^8]
