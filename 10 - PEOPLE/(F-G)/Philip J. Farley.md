Philip J. Farley was an aide to [[Christian A. Herter]], serving as a special assistant to [[John Foster Dulles]] for arms control since 1956. When asked by Herter to approach the French about their involvement with [[Israel]]'s nuclear program, Farley knew that a direct approach would be "pointless." He quietly raised the issue with a deputy to the French ambassador and came away convinced that the fears about a French connection were warranted.[^1]
