Shalheveth Freier was an Israeli nuclear physicist with impeccable credentials. He served as scientific counselor to the Israeli embassy in [[Paris]] during the critical days of the 1950s, when the Israeliâ€“French nuclear understanding was reached. Freier enjoyed high standing among international scientists and was particularly well known to American nuclear weapons designers.[^1]

Freier was the replacement for [[Aharon Katzir]] as the innovative physicist in charge of [[Dimona]] after Katzir's death in May 1972. During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], Freier provided a separate, preliminary briefing to [[Golda Meir]]'s "kitchen cabinet" on the nuclear weapons and targets available for immediate assembly.[^1]
