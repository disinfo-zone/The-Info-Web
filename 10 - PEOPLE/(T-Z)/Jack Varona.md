Dr. [[Jack Varona]] was the assistant deputy director of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] for technical affairs. He was the head of the [[USA|U.S.]] delegation at an [[Israel|Israel]]-[[USA|U.S.]] intelligence exchange conference in late September 1979.[^1]

[[Jack Varona|Varona]] was criticized by [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] for his indifference and lack of understanding regarding the [[Iraq|Iraqi]] threat to [[Iran]]. He was more concerned with obtaining details about [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-made military equipment than with the urgent situation in [[Iran]].[^1]
