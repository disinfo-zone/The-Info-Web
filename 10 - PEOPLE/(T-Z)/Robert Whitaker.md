> This page is a placeholder and requires extensive additions. Difficulties have arisen from how common the name Robert Whitaker is.

Worked on the team developing the original 1969 [[PROMIS]] under [[Joan E. Jacoby]], [[Charles R. Work]], and [[Bill Hamilton]].

There are a huge amounts of Robert Whitakers working in the government, but we can assume that in 1969, Robert was an Executive Officer[^4] of the DC Department of Corrections and in 1970, Executive Assistant to the Director of the Department of Corrections DC[^1]. He seems to have represented the Metropolitan Police Department’s interests in an on-line records management system[^4].

Further records of Robert Whitakers can be found working in the secret service (1982)[^3] and Office of Personnel Management (1985)[^2]. It’s not at all clear if these are related to the Whitaker who worked on PROMIS.

There was an issue of Corrections Magazine in 1974 that mentions a Robert Whitaker, who runs a correction center, used to be a marine[^5]. It’s possible this is the same Whitaker as the Corrections field is fairly small even with a relatively common name.
