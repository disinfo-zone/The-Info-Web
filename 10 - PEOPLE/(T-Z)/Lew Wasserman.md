[[Lew Wasserman]] was the Chairman of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Corporation. He was a powerful figure in Hollywood and a long-time political supporter of [[Ronald Reagan]]. Wasserman represented Reagan during the actor's early days in Hollywood, and along with [[Jules Stein]], [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s founder, negotiated the sale of Reagan's [[California]] properties at hugely inflated prices, which helped make Reagan a millionaire.[^1]

Wasserman was a major contributor to and sat on the board of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] presidential library, along with [[Edwin Meese]] and others. He was involved in raising $80 million to build it.[^1]

Wasserman was connected to organized crime. He was on the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Board of Directors during the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation into alleged mob ties to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. [[Edward Sciandra]] reportedly wanted to go to Wasserman and [[Sidney Sheinberg]] (President of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]) and tell them who they were up against.[^1]

[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Nancy Reagan]] were known to celebrate New Year's Eve with Wasserman and his wife, Edie. [[Howard Baker]] returned to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s board of directors in March 1989, just in time to help Wasserman celebrate his seventy-sixth birthday.[^1]
