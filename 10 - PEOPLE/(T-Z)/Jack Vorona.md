Jack Vorona was the Assistant Director for Scientific and Technical Intelligence at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA) and served as the overall manager of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program. He played a crucial role in the continuation and restructuring of the U.S. government's psychic research programs after the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] scaled back its involvement[^1][^2].

In 1981, Vorona contacted [[Dale Graff]] and brought him to Washington, D.C., to help run a classified program called [[Psychoenergetics]]. The main goals of this project were "to evaluate the threat that foreign psychoenergetics achievements might pose to US national security, and to explore the potential of psychoenergetics for use in US intelligence collection"[^2]. Vorona believed that with the resources of the DIA, genuine progress could be made toward a general theory of [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]][^2].

Vorona oversaw the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program and later the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Sun Streak]] program, which aimed to train military personnel in [[Remote Viewing]]. He made administrative changes, converting the branch chief and operations officer positions from military to civilian, and reducing training time[^2].

He was also involved in high-priority operational tasks, such as the effort to locate [[William Richard Higgins]], a Marine Lieutenant Colonel abducted in [[Lebanon]], and the tracking of [[Muammar Qaddafi]]'s alleged chemical weapons stockpile. In the latter case, Vorona sat with [[Angela Dellafiora]] in the viewing room at [[Fort Meade]], demonstrating the high-level attention given to her abilities[^2].

Vorona chaired the Remote Viewing Tasking Group for Sun Streak, which included representatives from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], [[National Security Agency|NSA]], [[State Department]], and various military and intelligence agencies. This group handled targets such as underground tunnels in [[Korea]], [[Silkworm Missile]] launch facilities in [[Iran]], and the errant nuclear-powered [[Cosmos 1900]] satellite[^2].

He received [[Hal Puthoff]]'s sixty-page classified report, "Psychoenergetics Research in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (1982)," which confirmed the extensive research into [[Extraordinary Human Body Function|EHBF]] and its military applications in [[China]], driven by [[H. S. Tsien]][^2].

Vorona, along with General [[Edmund Thompson]], briefed Congressman [[Charlie Rose]] on the Grill Flame program in the late 1970s. He accompanied Rose on tours of the remote viewing facilities at both [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] and [[Fort Meade]], and was a staunch supporter of the program, despite the skepticism it faced[^1].

Jack Vorona retired after twenty-five years of service at DIA and was inducted into the DIA's Torch Bearers Hall in 2011[^2].
