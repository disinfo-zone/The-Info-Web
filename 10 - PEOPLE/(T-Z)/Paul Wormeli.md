Paul Wormeli was the Vice President in charge of Product Development for [[Simeon]], Inc., a company that was purchased by Hadron in 1982. He remained with Simeon for two years after the acquisition.

Wormeli accompanied [[Dominic Laiti]] on a business trip to New York City in late 1983, which [[Bill Hamilton]] alleged was to raise capital to buy [[PROMIS]]. Wormeli confirmed that the trip was to raise money for Simeon and that he and Laiti met with [[Earl Brian]] and executives from Allen and Company, including [[Mark Kesselman]], to discuss funding. However, Wormeli stated that neither Laiti nor Brian ever discussed the acquisition of PROMIS or [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] with him, and that Laiti never mentioned PROMIS or Inslaw to him or at any of the New York meetings. Wormeli first became aware of Inslaw's problems with the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] from reading newspaper articles. While sympathetic to Hamilton's view, Wormeli maintained he had no knowledge of a connection between Hadron and Inslaw.[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation found that Wormeli's testimony did not support Hamilton's thesis that the New York trip was to raise money to buy PROMIS. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence from Wormeli or other interviewed individuals that Hadron or Simeon ever had any interest in obtaining Inslaw's software.[^1]
