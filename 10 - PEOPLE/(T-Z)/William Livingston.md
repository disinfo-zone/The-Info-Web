[[Dr. William Livingston]], referred to as Will, is a medical doctor and surgeon who served as a medical advisor to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and [[Robert Bigelow]]'s [[National Institute for Discovery Science]] (NIDS). He is described as having presided over the little-known "weird desk" at the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), where he was in charge of investigating unusual medical issues, implants, and abductions related to [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) encounters.[^1]

### Investigation of Biological Effects

Dr. Livingston was a key figure in the investigation of the biological effects of UAP encounters on humans. He studied numerous cases of individuals who had suffered a range of medical issues following their encounters with UAP, including radiation-like burns, neurological damage, and other unexplained medical conditions. He was instrumental in bringing in [[Dr. Garry Nolan]] to analyze the brains of UAP experiencers, which led to the discovery of the correlation between the enhanced caudate-putamen and individuals with a high aptitude for [[Remote Viewing]].[^1]

Dr. Livingston was also involved in the investigation of alleged alien implants. He is said to have had access to samples of these objects, which were described as being able to move on their own and evade extraction. His work in this area highlighted the bizarre and often terrifying medical consequences of close encounters with UAP.[^1]
