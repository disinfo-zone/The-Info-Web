Charles Trombetta was identified by [[Lois Battistoni]] as an individual who might have information about the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] and [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]. However, when interviewed by the Special Counsel, Trombetta stated that he had no direct knowledge of the [[INSLAW]] matter. He did suggest that [[Garnett Taylor]] might possess information concerning Inslaw documents held by the DOJ security office, but he could not provide any further details.[^1]
