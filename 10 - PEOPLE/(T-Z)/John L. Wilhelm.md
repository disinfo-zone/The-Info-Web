# John L. Wilhelm

John L. Wilhelm was a journalist and a skeptic of [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and other anomalous mental phenomena. He is known for his *Washington Post* article, "Psychic Spying? The [[CIA]], the [[Pentagon]] and the Russians Probe the Military Potential of [[Parapsychology]]," published on August 7, 1977[^1].

Wilhelm's exposé centered on the [[U.S. Navy]]'s top scientist, [[Samuel Koslov]], who publicly expressed outrage about the [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] project on ESP, claiming he had demanded its cessation. Koslov told Wilhelm, "If you ask me, ‘Do you think it’s a pile of crap?’ I do, and you can quote me." Wilhelm's article highlighted the public relations nightmare faced by Koslov, especially as the nefarious details surrounding the [[Moscow Signal]] and [[Project Pandora]] had only recently become public[^1].
