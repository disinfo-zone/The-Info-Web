[[Ezer Weizman]] was an [[Israel|Israeli]] politician and military leader. He served as Defense Minister under [[Menachem Begin 1]] and later became President of [[Israel]].[^1]

[[Ezer Weizman|Weizman]] urged [[Menachem Begin 1|Begin]] to sign the [[Camp David Accords]], which [[Menachem Begin 1|Begin]] reluctantly did under pressure from [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]]. In 1978, [[Menachem Begin 1|Begin]] dispatched [[Ezer Weizman|Weizman]] to [[Pretoria]] to meet [[P.W. Botha|Prime Minister P.W. Botha]] of [[South Africa]] to discuss [[Israel|Israeli]]-[[South Africa|South African]] relations. Despite [[Menachem Begin 1|Begin's]] intentions to downgrade the relationship, [[Ezer Weizman|Weizman]] agreed with [[P.W. Botha|Botha]] on a wartime alliance between the two governments as the price for continuing nuclear tests. This led to the creation of [[SIMWA]] (SADF-IDF Mutual Wartime Agreement).[^1]
