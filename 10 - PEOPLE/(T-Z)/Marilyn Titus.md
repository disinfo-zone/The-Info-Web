Marilyn Titus worked for [[Simeon]] from September 1982 until January 1984, and then for [[Hadron]] for four years after leaving Simeon. Simeon was a subsidiary of Hadron, Inc.

[[Bill Hamilton]]'s affidavit claimed that Titus, then secretary to [[Paul Wormeli]], stated that the purpose of a 1983 fundraising trip to New York by [[Dominic Laiti]] and Wormeli was to "raise capital to buy the court [i.e. [[PROMIS]]] software."[^1]

Titus, however, denied this. She told investigators that to her knowledge, the only court-related software company Simeon/Hadron ever had an interest in purchasing was a Southern California company called Responsive Design. She stated that she never heard any discussion about Hadron obtaining PROMIS software and did not believe she ever told William Hamilton that the purpose of the 1983 fundraising trip was to acquire PROMIS or [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]. She also confirmed that she was not present at or a participant in any conversations Simeon or Hadron personnel had about Inslaw, and that no one ever made a statement in her presence indicating that Wormeli and Laiti attempted to raise capital to buy Inslaw, or that Hadron had any interest in acquiring Inslaw or PROMIS. Furthermore, she said no one made any statements in her presence that indicated they were contemplating any unethical or illegal activities to acquire PROMIS.[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation concluded that Titus's statements did not support Hamilton's claims and that there was no evidence from her or other interviewed individuals that Hadron or Simeon ever had any interest in obtaining Inslaw's software.[^1]
