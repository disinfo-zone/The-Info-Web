Lyall Watson was a South African zoologist and anthropologist. He was one of two scientists, along with King's College professor [[John Taylor]], who witnessed [[Uri Geller]]'s demonstrations live on [[BBC]] television's *Dimbleby Talk-In* show. During the broadcast, Geller bent and broke a fork, started a broken watch, and reproduced a drawing hidden in a sealed envelope[^1].
