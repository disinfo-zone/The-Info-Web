Garnett Taylor was a former security officer at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. He was identified by [[Lois Battistoni]] and an unnamed senior U.S. Government official (according to [[Bill Hamilton]]) as having information about the [[PROMIS Software Scandal|Inslaw matter]]. Specifically, Hamilton's source alleged that Taylor knew about the destruction of a number of [[INSLAW|Inslaw]] documents by the Justice Department's Office of Security.[^1]

Taylor supervised by [[James Walker]], Chief Security Specialist with the Justice Management Division, for approximately one year before being transferred to Personnel Security. As a control officer, Taylor was responsible for shredding classified documents once a determination was made that they need not be retained. However, he did not review classified files of departing DOJ attorneys to determine retention or shredding; rather, the attorney themselves would make that determination.[^1]

When interviewed, [[Charles Trombetta]] suggested that Taylor might have information concerning Inslaw documents held by the DOJ security office. William Hamilton also stated that Taylor knew that [[Anthony Moscato]], then Acting Director of EOUSA, played an affirmative role on behalf of the DOJ in denying Bankruptcy Judge Bason's reappointment. However, Moscato denied any involvement in the selection of bankruptcy judges and stated he was not familiar with Judge Norma Johnson or the Merit Selection Panel. He also noted that Taylor and he were not social friends or confidants.[^1]
