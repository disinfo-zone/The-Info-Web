[[Paul Zalis]] was a staff writer for the *Indio Daily News* (currently known as the *Desert Sun*). He reported on the subsequent killings of [[Fred Alvarez]], [[Ralph Boger]], and [[Patricia Castro]]. Zalis wrote that [[Indio City Manager]] [[Phillip Hawes]] confirmed that [[William Cole]], a Los Angeles-based attorney, had been hired to investigate possible links between the triple slayings and the [[Cabazon Casino]].[^1]

Zalis also reported that [[Fred Alvarez]], [[Joseph R. (Mike) Benitez]], and [[William Callaway]] had previously divulged their findings to him in May 1981, asserting that they were marked for death, but their story never got published.[^1]
