[[Sir Hubert Wilkins]] was an Australian polar explorer, aviator, and decorated war hero. He was the first man to fly from North America to the polar regions of Europe and attempted to reach the North Pole in a surplus World War I submarine. His ashes were later scattered at the North Pole by the [[USS Skate]].[^1]

Wilkins conducted experiments in [[Mind-to-Mind Telepathy]], which he documented in his book *Thoughts Through Space: A Remarkable Adventure in the Realm of Mind*. His work influenced [[Edgar Mitchell]], the Apollo 14 astronaut, who was inspired to conduct his own telepathy experiments during his Moon voyage.[^1]
