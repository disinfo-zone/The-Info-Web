General [[Yekutiel Adam]] was an [[Israel|Israeli]] military leader who was in line to take over as Director of [[Mossad]] in 1981. However, he was assassinated by his own people, according to [[Rafi Eitan]], who claimed it was an inside job. The old guard in [[Mossad]] were reportedly afraid of him because he had told people in the [[Prime Minister's Office]] that he would make a clean sweep of the intelligence network.[^1]

Prior to his assassination, [[Yekutiel Adam|Adam]] lost a number of top-secret documents when he left his briefcase behind in a [[Los Angeles]] gas station, which caused a huge internal row within [[Mossad]] and an unsuccessful attempt to stop his appointment.[^1]
