[[Leslie Van Meter]] was the widow of [[Ron Van Meter]], a deputy in the Mariposa Sheriff's Department. She was notified of her husband's disappearance after his alleged boating accident on Lake McClure. Her home was subsequently ransacked, and her husband's briefcase and diary were seized by the Mariposa Sheriff's Department. She and a few deputies were the only ones who knew the contents of Van Meter's diary. A special life insurance policy taken out by Ron two weeks before his death also went missing after the search.[^1]

On March 23, 1984, [[Leslie Van Meter]] filed a Citizen's Complaint with the Mariposa County Sheriff's Department, alleging negligence and unprofessionalism in the investigation of her husband's disappearance, as his body had still not been found. She requested the case be re-opened. On July 6, 1985, she filed a "Request for Official Inquiry" with the State of [[California]] Department of Boating and Waterways, stating that no satisfactory investigation had been conducted.[^1]
