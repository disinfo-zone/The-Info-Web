[[Bill Turner]] was a friend and confidante of investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]]. He met with Casolaro in the parking lot of the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, Virginia, on August 9, 1991, the day before Casolaro's death, to deliver some papers. These papers allegedly included two sealed packages that Turner had been keeping in his safe for Casolaro, and a packet of Hughes Aircraft papers belonging to Turner, who had been let go from Hughes for whistleblowing.[^1]

Turner later admitted to police that he met with Casolaro but initially refused to specify the time or describe the contents of the papers. He claimed not to know what was in the sealed documents, which had Casolaro's name written across the seal. It was suggested that Turner might have known who Casolaro was preparing to meet that evening and wanted Casolaro to show the Hughes Aircraft documents to that individual.[^1]

Turner stated he was "scared shitless" about information he had seen connecting [[Oliver North]] and the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]]. He claimed to have seen papers from Casolaro that linked back through the Keating Five and Silverado, a failed Denver Savings and Loan where [[Neil Bush]] had been an officer.[^1]

[[Bill Hamilton]], president of [[INSLAW]], later stated that he had received an affidavit from Bill Turner on "highly classified computer printouts on off-shore accounts that he claimed Casolaro intended to use the night he died in a planned meeting with [[Peter Videnieks]] and [[Joseph Cuellar]] and others."[^1]
