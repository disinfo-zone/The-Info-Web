Llewellyn Thomas (1903â€“1972) was an American diplomat who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] from 1957 to 1962 and again from 1967 to 1969. He was one of the ambassadors who was subjected to the [[Moscow Signal]], a microwave beam aimed at the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] by the Soviets[^1].

Thomas died of cancer on February 6, 1972, at the age of sixty-seven. His death, along with that of [[Charles Bohlen]] and later [[Walter Stoessel Jr.]], raised concerns about the potential health effects of prolonged exposure to the Moscow Signal[^1].
