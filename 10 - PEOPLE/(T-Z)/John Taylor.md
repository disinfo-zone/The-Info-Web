John Taylor was a professor at King's College. He was one of two scientists, along with South African zoologist and anthropologist [[Lyall Watson]], who witnessed [[Uri Geller]]'s demonstrations live on [[BBC]] television's *Dimbleby Talk-In* show. During the broadcast, Geller bent and broke a fork, started a broken watch, and reproduced a drawing hidden in a sealed envelope[^1].

Professor Taylor expressed wonder at Geller's abilities, stating, "I believe this process... I believe that you actually broke the fork here and now." This public endorsement from a scientist contributed to the phenomenon of "conversion moments" occurring on live television, where individuals became convinced of Geller's powers[^1].
