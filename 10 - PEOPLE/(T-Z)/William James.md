[[William James]] was a pioneering American psychologist and philosopher, often referred to as the "Father of American psychology." He was a leading thinker of the late 19th century and a key figure in the development of pragmatism.[^1]

James was also deeply interested in psychic phenomena and was one of the founders of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in 1885. He believed that the scientific study of such phenomena was crucial for a complete understanding of human consciousness and the nature of reality.[^1]
