[[Romeo Vásquez Velásquez]] was a Brigadier General and head of the armed forces of [[Honduras]]. He was sacked by President [[Manuel Zelaya]] on June 25, 2009, for refusing to allow the armed forces to help in conducting a referendum on a constitutional change proposed by President Zelaya. He, along with [[General Daniel Lopez Carballo]], was identified as a coup leader who ousted [[Manuel Zelaya]] and placed [[Roberto Micheletti]] in office.[^1]

Vásquez Velásquez attended the [[School of the Americas]] (SOA/WHINSEC) at least twice, in 1976 and 1984. He was also mentioned as a friend of [[Jimmy Hughes]] and a member of FGBMFI ([[Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International]]).[^1]
