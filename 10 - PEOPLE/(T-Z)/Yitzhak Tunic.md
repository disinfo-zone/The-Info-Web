[[Yitzhak Tunic]] was the lawyer for [[Michael Dennis Rohan]], who carried out the 1969 arson attack on the [[El Aqsa Mosque]]. He was later appointed as the state comptroller (ombudsman) of [[Israel]].[^1]

[[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan]] believed that [[Yitzhak Tunic|Tunic]] "sold him down the river" because he was afraid [[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan]] might mention the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL) if he took the witness stand. [[Yitzhak Tunic|Tunic's]] actions were part of the suppression of the [[El Aqsa Mosque]] arson case for "reasons of State interests."[^1]
