[[General Torrijos]] was a figure in [[Panama]] whose family members were reportedly heavily involved at the highest levels of the world cocaine trade. During [[Jimmy Carter]]'s presidency, the Carter administration was reportedly reluctant to pursue Torrijos due to its determination in 1977 to sign a [[Panama Canal]] treaty with him.[^1]
