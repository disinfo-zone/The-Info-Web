[[Baruch Weiss]] was an Assistant [[USA|U.S.]] Attorney for the Southern District of [[New York]]. He was the prosecutor in the trial of [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] and [[Richard St. Francis]] for conspiracy to sell [[C-130]] aircraft to [[Iran]].[^1]

[[Baruch Weiss|Weiss]] initially classified [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe]] as dangerous, but later admitted it was a mistake. He signed an agreement with [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe]] to talk without a lawyer present, granting him immunity for the conversations. [[Baruch Weiss|Weiss]] insisted that [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe]] was a low-level translator acting for personal profit, but the taped conversations and [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe's]] employment records, including letters of recommendation, contradicted this claim.[^1]
