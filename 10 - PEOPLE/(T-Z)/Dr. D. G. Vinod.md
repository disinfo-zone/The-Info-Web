Dr. D. G. Vinod was a Hindu scholar and mystic who [[Andrija Puharich]] met in New York City in 1952. Puharich was deeply impressed by Vinod's apparent ability to divine his past and future with remarkable accuracy.[^1]

Puharich brought Vinod to the [[Round Table Foundation]], where Vinod allegedly went into a trance and channeled a group of entities called "[[the Nine Principles and Forces]]." This event had a profound impact on Puharich, solidifying his belief in an external, possibly extraterrestrial, source for psychic phenomena. The s√©ance was attended by several of the foundation's wealthy benefactors, including [[Alice Astor Bouverie]] and [[Marcella Miller du Pont]].[^1]
