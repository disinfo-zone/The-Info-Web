[[Sue Todd]] is a Police Detective from Hercules, California. She became involved in the investigation surrounding the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] and its broader implications, particularly through her collaboration with [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] national security investigator [[Sean McDade]].[1]

Todd accompanied [[Sean McDade]] during his secret entry into the [[United States]] in February 2000, where they met with [[Cheri Seymour]], the author of *The Last Circle*. Their collaboration stemmed from a shared "source" and Todd's own investigation into a three-year-old double homicide that she believed was connected to the [[PROMIS]] case. During their meeting with Seymour, Todd and McDade were armed with 9mm police guns, indicating the serious nature of their inquiry.[1]

She assisted [[Sean McDade]] in his extensive probe, which involved interviewing former investigators, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel across the [[United States]]. Todd was also a point of contact for [[Sean McDade]] when he found himself targeted by [[ECHELON]] technology during his investigation, forcing him to take extraordinary measures to communicate securely.[1]

Despite the exposure of [[Sean McDade]]'s investigation in the *Toronto Star* in August 2000, Todd indicated that he ultimately returned to police work in his hometown, suggesting a continued commitment to law enforcement despite the challenges faced during the [[PROMIS]] investigation.[1]
