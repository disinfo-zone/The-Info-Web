Colonel [[Yosef Zeira]] was a stern department commander in [[Unit 8200]], an [[Israel|Israeli]] Signals Intelligence (Sigint) unit. He was responsible for briefing a team of officers, including [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], about the secret commando raid to rescue [[Israel|Israeli]] and other passengers from a hijacked [[Air France]] jet at [[Entebbe Airport]] in [[Uganda]] in July 1976. He ordered the team to "disappear" for the duration of the operation, with no contact with their families.[^1]
