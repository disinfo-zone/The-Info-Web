William Sessions was the Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He became involved in the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] due to allegations that the FBI's Field Office Information Management System ([[FOIMS]]) was a pirated version of [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s [[PROMIS]] software.

In January 1991, [[Terry D. Miller]], President of Government Sales Consultants, Inc., sent a letter to Director Sessions, alleging that FOIMS was stolen. In response, Sessions offered the FBI's complete cooperation to the Special Counsel's investigation, agreeing to a request to examine the FOIMS software. He requested reasonable security-related conditions, including requiring the expert to have appropriate security clearance. The Special Counsel's investigation ultimately concluded that FOIMS was not PROMIS or any derivative of PROMIS, and that it was developed independently by the FBI.[^1]
