Paul C. Warnke served as the assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs. He was involved in intense pressure on [[Israel]] to sign the [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty|NPT]] in exchange for F-4 fighter jets. Warnke directly questioned [[Yitzhak Rabin]], then [[Israel]]'s ambassador to [[Washington D.C.]], about [[Israel]]'s nuclear capabilities, stating, "we are shocked at the manner in which you are dealing with us.â€¦ You, our close ally, are building nuclear bombs in [[Israel]] behind our back."[^1]
