[[Ted Gunderson]] was a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who transitioned into private investigation after his retirement from the Bureau. His distinguished career with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] included serving as a Senior Special Agent in Charge (SAC) at headquarters in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and Dallas, Texas. Following his tenure with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], he worked for F. Lee Bailey, Esq., before establishing his own investigative agency in Los Angeles County.[1]

Gunderson became deeply involved in the investigation of corruption and drug rings within Mariposa County, California, after being approached by the D.I.G. (Decency in Government) group. His prior work included compiling a comprehensive 700-page report for the Tulare City Council, which meticulously detailed instances of deputies receiving payoffs and distributing drugs in Tulare. His engagement in the Mariposa investigation marked a significant expansion of his efforts into the broader "[[The Octopus]]" inquiry.[1]

His professional network and investigative pursuits were intricately linked with several key figures and clandestine operations. He served as a crucial contact for [[Michael Riconosciuto]], particularly following Riconosciuto's arrest. Riconosciuto initiated contact with Gunderson from jail, and Gunderson subsequently informed [[Cheri Seymour]] about Riconosciuto's ongoing investigation into the Mariposa County corruption and drug ring. Furthermore, Gunderson provided an affidavit and testimony during Riconosciuto's trial, aiming to corroborate Riconosciuto's covert government-sanctioned activities. At one point, Gunderson, Riconosciuto, and [[Robert Booth Nichols]] were colloquially described as being "inseparable, like the three musketeers," highlighting their close association.[1]

His involvement extended to discussions with [[Ralph Olberg]] and [[Tim Osman]] concerning a global support network for the [[Mujahideen]] in [[Afghanistan]]. These discussions encompassed the field testing of novel weaponry and the exchange of arms for drugs, an operation connected to "[[The Company]]," a drug and arms organization comprising former military, law enforcement, and intelligence personnel. Gunderson's affidavit detailed conversations about the modification of Chinese 107 MM rockets and the strategic sanitization of Stinger missiles to prevent the leakage of sensitive information if they were to be captured by Soviet forces.[1]

Despite their past collaboration, Gunderson faced limitations in disclosing numerous activities involving [[Robert Booth Nichols]] during Riconosciuto's trial, as Nichols was concurrently under [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation for alleged involvement in organized crime. Interestingly, Gunderson had previously conducted an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] background check on Nichols, which, to his surprise, indicated Nichols was "squeaky clean," a finding that later contrasted sharply with information suggesting Nichols' deep entanglement in drug trafficking and organized crime.[1]

[[Danny Casolaro]], the investigative journalist, maintained contact with Gunderson during his "[[The Octopus]]" investigation. Casolaro confirmed that [[Ralph Olberg]]'s project to provide arms assistance to the Afghan rebels was legally sanctioned and operated through the State Department and Senator Humphrey's office.[1]

Throughout his career, Gunderson encountered significant challenges and obstruction in his efforts to expose corruption. He observed a "turf battle problem" between [[Ralph Olberg]]'s group and certain factions within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and their group, MSH (Management Science For Health), concerning the legitimate representation of the Afghan rebel leadership. His attempts to facilitate [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s entry into the Witness Protection Program ultimately proved unsuccessful, as federal agencies, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], demonstrated reluctance to fully cooperate or acknowledge Riconosciuto's claims.[1]
