Joseph E. Vaez was an officer in the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)]].[^1]

### Role in BCCI Investigation

In February 1978, Vaez submitted a report on the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] that characterized it as a bank dangerously out of control.[^1] He was sent with a team of auditors to examine the books of [[Bank of America]], which held 30 percent of BCCI's shares.[^2] His memo provided a detailed summary of BCCI's operations, noting its explosive growth, lack of lending limits, and undocumented loans.[^2]

Vaez's report concluded that BCCI's practices were glaringly obvious as far back as 1978. The report also highlighted that money was disappearing into "unsecured borrowings" in [[ICIC]] in the [[Cayman Islands]], and that bad or questionable loans constituted three and a half times BCCI's capital.[^3]

Despite the significance of his report, the OCC claimed to have "lost" the memo. When Vaez later agreed to provide a copy from his own files, the OCC refused to let investigators have it, only releasing it after a congressional subpoena.[^2]
