William Xenakis was a Lieutenant Colonel who commanded Detachment G, the [[Remote Viewing]] unit at [[Fort Meade]]. He ordered [[Ed Dames]] to cease his "bogus targets," which included anomalous destinations not in the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] protocols, such as alien bases and UFO encounters[^1].

Xenakis's intervention indicates an attempt to bring the unit back to its intended purpose of intelligence gathering and to curb the unconventional targeting practices that had become prevalent under Dames's management[^1].
