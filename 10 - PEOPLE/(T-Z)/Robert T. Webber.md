Robert T. Webber was a physicist who served as the scientific attaché at the U.S. embassy in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]]. He earned a doctorate in physics at [[Yale University]] and shared [[William N. Dale]]'s interest in [[Dimona]]. Webber worked closely with [[John L. Hadden]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] station chief, in clear violation of a [[State Department]] decree forbidding scientific attachés from engaging in intelligence work. He also relied on intelligence gathered by [[Mel Alba]] and encouraged collaboration with British and Canadian counterparts. Webber was eventually replaced as science attaché by someone much less interested in [[Dimona]].[^1]
