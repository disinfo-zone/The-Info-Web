He graduated from Wesleyan University (B.A., 1962), the University of Chicago Law School (J.D., 1965), and the Georgetown University Law Center (LL.M., 1966). He passed the bar exam in 1965.

In 1966 Work became an Assistant United States Attorney (criminal trial section). In 1969 he moved to to the Superior Court Division, the division responsible for prosecuting all local crime in the District of Columbia, as Deputy Chief and finally Chief until he left in 1973.

In 1973, Work became the Deputy Administrator of the [[LEAA|Law Enforcement Assistance Administration]] (via [[Richard Nixon|Richard Nixon's]] Presidential nomination and Senate confirmation) within the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] until 1975 at which point he became a partner at Peabody, Lambert & Meyers. In 1983 Work moved to McDermott, Will & Emery where he was the Partner-In-Charge of DC through 1997 (now retired).[^2]

Following Nixon’s resignation, Work was close personal friends with one of [[Ford administration|President Ford’s]] speech writers and used that connection to encourage Ford to come out as tough on crime and career criminals (bolstering the LEAA).[^3]

In 1985, [[Reagan administration|Ronald Reagan]] appointed him a member of the District of Columbia Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure, the body that reappoints and disciplines the judges of the District of Columbia.
