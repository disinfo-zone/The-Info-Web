William von Raab was the [[U.S. Customs Service]] Commissioner.[^1]

He was involved in the [[Hashemi sting]] operation, which was designed to entrap individuals connected with [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence arms sales to [[Iran]].[^2]

Von Raab, along with [[Rudolph Giuliani]], gave joint TV interviews on April 22, 1986, announcing the arrest of a "huge ring of terrorists" and "Merchants of Death" who were supposedly about to sell arms worth a billion dollars to [[Iran]]. [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] claims that von Raab and his associates had created the crime themselves.[^2]

### Role in BCCI Scandal

Von Raab headed the agency during the Tampa money-laundering investigations involving the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^1] He stated that the [[C-Chase]] sting operation, which led to the arrest of several BCCI bankers, was the most important money-laundering case in history.[^3]

After BCCI's Tampa conviction, von Raab thought the case was "enormously meaningful" and announced it publicly. He was told by his superiors to dampen his public enthusiasm.[^4] He later testified before the [[John Kerry|Kerry]] subcommittee that the [[Justice Department]] had denied knowledge of the [[Ali Mirza]] tapes, which contained crucial information about BCCI's activities.[^5]
