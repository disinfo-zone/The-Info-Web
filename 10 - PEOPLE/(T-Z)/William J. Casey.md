William J. Casey served as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) under President [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[KH-11]] imagery-sharing program with [[Israel]] from the moment he took office. Early in his tenure, he ordered that Israeli liaison officers be provided with a private office near [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] headquarters to ensure all essential intelligence was turned over.[^1]

After the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak]], Casey authorized a small, ad hoc committee of experts to review [[Israel]]'s potential abuse of the KH-11 intelligence-sharing agreement. The review found that [[Israel]] had significantly expanded the agreement, requesting and receiving extensive KH-11 coverage of western [[Russia]], including [[Moscow]].[^1]
