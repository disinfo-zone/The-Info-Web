William Ryback was the Deputy Director of Banking Supervision at the [[Federal Reserve]].[^1]

### Role in BCCI Investigation

Ryback was the Federal Reserve's spearhead in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]]-[[First American Bank]] case.[^2] He had repeatedly investigated the supposed connections between the two banks but had found no concrete evidence.[^2]

In December 1990, Ryback traveled to [[London]] and demanded to see the October 1990 audit report of BCCI from [[Zafar Iqbal]], who had recently taken over BCCI.[^2] This audit revealed over $1 billion in loans to an entity coded "[[XYZ Corp]]." and that the loans were secured by stock in XYZ, with no repayment.[^2] Ryback concluded that "XYZ Corp." was actually [[First American Bank]] and that the loans were made to front men.[^2]

Ryback's findings led him to believe that BCCI had been lying to the Federal Reserve for years, and he sought to have [[Clark Clifford]] and [[Robert Altman]] investigated for withholding this vital information.[^2]
