Brad Veek was a cartographer and career submariner who played a role in [[Project Deep Quest]]. He was responsible for creating a composite map from the individual maps marked up by psychics [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Hella Hammid]] during their [[Map Dowsing]] efforts to locate a shipwreck[^1].

This composite map was then taken by [[Stephan Schwartz]] to the Bureau of Marine Sites of the [[U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey]] for official opinion and verification, helping to narrow down the search area for the *Taurus I* submersible[^1].
