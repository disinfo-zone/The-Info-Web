Hartleigh Trent was a former Navy petty officer and one of the original six remote viewers in the [[STARGATE PROJECT]]. He was recruited into the program, then codenamed [[STARGATE PROJECT|Gondola Wish]], in 1977 by [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] and [[Murray Watt|Scotty Watt]].[^1]

Trent was the oldest of the initial group of remote viewers, in his fifties, and had a background as a photo-interpreter. He was described as a "restless tinkerer and inventor," having built a large solar-powered hot-water heater at his home. He was also a close friend of [[Mel Riley]] and [[Joe McMoneagle]].[^1]

As a remote viewer, Trent was noted for his unusual ability to take directions at a target, even in confusing situations. In one instance, when asked to describe what was to his right, left, and front at a Soviet site, he accurately reported seeing a transmission, realizing he was lying under a truck.[^1]

Trent was one of the six most promising members of the team selected to travel to [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) for further evaluation of their talents. He participated in the intense, round-the-clock remote viewing sessions during the Iran hostage crisis, and was present when [[Jackie Keith]] suffered a fatal heart attack.[^1]
