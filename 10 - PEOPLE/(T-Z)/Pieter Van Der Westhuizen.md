[[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen]] was the chief of [[South African Military Intelligence]]. He played a significant role in the arms trade and intelligence cooperation between [[South Africa]] and other nations, including [[Israel]] and [[Chile]].[^1]

In 1983, [[Mark Thatcher]] introduced [[Gerald Bull]] to [[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen|Van Der Westhuizen]], who then connected Bull with [[South African Arms Corporation|ARMSCOR]] for his "supergun" project. [[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen|Van Der Westhuizen]] was also present at a meeting in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], in late 1986 with [[Carlos Cardoen]], [[Robert Gates]], and Senator [[John Tower]], where the [[USA|U.S.]] reaffirmed its intention to maintain arms channels to [[Iraq]] through [[South Africa]] and [[Chile]].[^1]

In November 1988, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] met with [[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen|Van Der Westhuizen]] in [[South Africa]]. The General claimed that [[South Africa]] had stopped the flow of technology to [[Iraq]] and was interested in resuming nuclear cooperation with [[Israel]]. He also confirmed [[Mark Thatcher|Thatcher's]] long-standing business dealings with [[South Africa]]. However, [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence later confirmed that while [[South Africa]] was not directly dealing with [[Iraq]], it was involved with [[Chile]], which continued to supply [[Iraq]] through the [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen]] network.[^1]

[[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen|Van Der Westhuizen]] was threatened by an [[Israel|Israeli]] counterpart for his continued involvement in supplying missile technology to [[Iraq]] through [[South African Arms Corporation|ARMSCOR]]. The [[South Africa|South African]] government was reportedly considering dismissing him from all official positions.[^1]
