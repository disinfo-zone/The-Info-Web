Jacques Vallée is a French-born computer scientist, astronomer, and [[UFOlogist]]. He worked at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] and carried a top-secret security clearance, being assigned to the SRI psychic research program as a "de facto unpaid consultant"[^1].

In early 1973, Vallée was working on a classified [[Department of Defense]] contract for [[ARPA]] involving a multiuser military computer network called [[ARPANET]], which later became the [[Internet]]. His expertise in information technology and computer programming, combined with his dedication to the study of [[Unidentified Flying Objects|UFOs]], made him a relatable figure for [[Ingo Swann]][^1].

Vallée observed Swann's frustration with the [[Outbounder-Beacon Experiment|outbounder-beacon experiments]], which Swann felt were a "trivialization of my abilities." Vallée suggested Swann approach the problem from the perspective of information technology, asking, "What do you do [when remote viewing]? Do you move your consciousness around?" Swann replied, "Yes, I can position it anywhere"[^1].

Vallée drew an analogy between long-distance [[Telepathy|telepathy]] and his work on the ARPANET, suggesting that a "virtual addressing" scheme could be applied to [[Remote Viewing]]. This idea, that accessing a virtual address was a means of accessing data beyond sensory grasp, inspired Swann to develop the concept of [[Coordinate Remote Viewing]] (CRV)[^1].

Vallée also commented on the mysterious death of [[Pat Price]], noting that when the [[FBI]] learned Price was a Scientologist, the church became a suspect in his death[^1].
