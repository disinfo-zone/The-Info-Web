Jacques Vallée is a French-born computer scientist, astronomer, and [[UFOlogist]]. He worked at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] and carried a top-secret security clearance, being assigned to the SRI psychic research program as a "de facto unpaid consultant"[^1].

In early 1973, Vallée was working on a classified [[Department of Defense]] contract for [[ARPA]] involving a multiuser military computer network called [[ARPANET]], which later became the [[Internet]]. His expertise in information technology and computer programming, combined with his dedication to the study of [[Unidentified Flying Objects|UFOs]], made him a relatable figure for [[Ingo Swann]][^1].

Vallée observed Swann's frustration with the [[Outbounder-Beacon Experiment|outbounder-beacon experiments]], which Swann felt were a "trivialization of my abilities." Vallée suggested Swann approach the problem from the perspective of information technology, asking, "What do you do [when remote viewing]? Do you move your consciousness around?" Swann replied, "Yes, I can position it anywhere"[^1].

Vallée drew an analogy between long-distance [[Telepathy|telepathy]] and his work on the ARPANET, suggesting that a "virtual addressing" scheme could be applied to [[Remote Viewing]]. This idea, that accessing a virtual address was a means of accessing data beyond sensory grasp, inspired Swann to develop the concept of [[Coordinate Remote Viewing]] (CRV)[^1].

Vallée also commented on the mysterious death of [[Pat Price]], noting that when the [[FBI]] learned Price was a Scientologist, the church became a suspect in his death[^1].

### Involvement with AATIP-Related Research

Dr. Vallée has continued his scientific investigation of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) into the modern era. He was involved in scientific research related to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP), collaborating with [[Dr. Garry Nolan]] on the analysis of a metallic slag recovered from a 1977 UAP crash in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Their research, published in the peer-reviewed journal "Progress in Aerospace Sciences," revealed that the material contained isotopes of magnesium and iron that were arranged in a highly structured and deliberate manner, a feat that is beyond our current technological capabilities.[^2]

His scientific background has informed his approach to UAP research, which has focused on data analysis and the development of a classification system for UAP sightings. He is the author of numerous books on the UAP topic, including "Anatomy of a Phenomenon" and "Passport to Magonia," in which he has explored the parallels between modern UAP encounters and historical folklore and mythology. He worked closely with Dr. J. Allen Hynek, the scientific consultant for the U.S. Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], and was the inspiration for the character of the French scientist, Claude Lacombe, in the movie "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."[^2]
