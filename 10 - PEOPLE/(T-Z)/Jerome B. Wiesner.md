Jerome B. Wiesner was President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s science adviser. He was Jewish, but was totally cut out of the intelligence about [[Dimona]], and assumed that [[David Ben-Gurion]] had requested that he not deal with that issue in the White House. Wiesner played a major role on disarmament issues for the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration and had served as a board member of the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]]. He frequently ran into Ben-Gurion on visits to [[Israel]], who would always ask him two questions: "Can computers think? And should we build a nuclear weapon?" Wiesner consistently answered "no" to the latter, which he believed marked him as a liberal in Ben-Gurion's eyes and limited his access.[^1]
