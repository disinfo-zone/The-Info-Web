Yakov Terletsky was the chairman of theoretical physics at [[Moscow University]] and a winner of the Laureate of the State Prize in the [[Soviet Union]]. He was working on hypotheses involving a subatomic particle called a [[Tachyon]], which is proposed to be superluminal, or faster-than-light[^1].

His work, along with that of [[Gerald Feinberg]], attracted the attention of [[Hal Puthoff]], who was interested in whether the tachyon flow could account for an "extra field" or force that physics couldn't yet see, potentially explaining [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and other anomalous mental phenomena[^1].
