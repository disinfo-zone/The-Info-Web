[[William Wolfe]] was a member of the [[Symbionese Liberation Army|Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA), a radical left-wing organization. He was a Berkeley dropout and was identified by [[Pat Price]] from a mug shot during the investigation into the [[Patty Hearst]] kidnapping. Price referred to him as "Lobo," Spanish for "wolf," which was one of Wolfe's nicknames ("Willie the Wolf"). Price also accurately described a bizarre anecdote about Wolfe's anesthetic-free dental surgery, relying instead on self-hypnosis.[^1]

Wolfe became [[Patty Hearst]]'s lover within the SLA. He was among the group of SLA members who were cornered and killed by police in a building in Los Angeles in May 1974.[^1]
