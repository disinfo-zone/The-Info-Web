[[Werner Tony Asmar]] was a German Lebanese intelligence agent who worked with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]. He was one of five key members of the MC-10 cell in [[Cyprus]] and Beirut. Asmar became aware of the alleged "non-controlled" loads of heroin being shipped back to the [[United States]] by [[Michael T. Hurley]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] operation. He reportedly went "toe to toe" with Hurley over this issue.[^1]

Asmar was killed in a bomb explosion at his office in east Beirut on May 26, 1988. His death was attributed to terrorists, but [[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that Asmar's cover was "deliberately blown." When Asmar was killed, the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] ordered [[Lester Coleman]] home.[^1]
