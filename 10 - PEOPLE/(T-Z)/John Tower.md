[[John Tower]] was a [[USA|U.S.]] Senator and a prominent figure with connections to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] circles. He served as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.[^1]

[[John Tower|Tower]] was introduced to [[Rafi Eitan]], then counterterrorism adviser to [[Menachem Begin 1]], in 1978. Eitan sought to build a network within the [[USA|United States]] to obtain information about Palestinian terrorists. [[John Tower|Tower]] and his senior aide, [[Robert McFarlane]], developed a close relationship with Eitan, and much information reaching the Senate Armed Services Committee found its way to Eitan's desk.[^1]

[[John Tower|Tower]] was involved in the secret negotiations concerning the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. He was present at a meeting in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], in late 1986 with [[Carlos Cardoen]], [[Robert Gates]], and [[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen|Gen. Pieter Van Der Westhuizen]] (South African Military Intelligence), where the [[USA|U.S.]] reaffirmed its intention to maintain arms channels to [[Iraq]].[^1]

[[Robert Maxwell]] claimed that when [[George Bush]] was head of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 1976, [[John Tower|Tower]] approached Maxwell to connect him and Bush secretly with various [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence people. Maxwell delivered, and [[John Tower|Tower]] became his friend for life, later being appointed a director of Maxwell's [[Macmillan]] publishing company in the [[USA|U.S.]].[^1]

[[John Tower|Tower]] approached [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell]] to market the [[PROMIS]] software on behalf of the [[Robert Gates|CIA]] group. He also personally gave [[Yitzhak Shamir]] permission to use [[USA|U.S.]] funds as a guarantee for Maxwell's publishing empire.[^1]

After the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] scandal broke, [[John Tower|Tower]] was appointed to head a presidential commission of inquiry into the affair. The [[Tower Commission]]'s conclusions were largely seen as a cover-up, focusing only on a minor part of the sales and making no mention of the ongoing original arms channel. [[George Bush]] later nominated [[John Tower|Tower]] for defense secretary, but he was not confirmed by [[USA|Congress]].[^1]

[[John Tower|Tower]] died in a plane crash in [[Georgia]] in early 1991.[^1]
