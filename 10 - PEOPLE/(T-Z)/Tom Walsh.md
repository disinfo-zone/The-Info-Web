[[Tom Walsh]] was a retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent from Merced. He was recruited by Sheriff [[Ken Mattheys]] in October 1984, along with private investigator [[Raymond Jenkins]], to investigate [[Ron Van Meter]]'s disappearance and help clean up the Mariposa Sheriff's Department. Walsh and Jenkins concluded that [[Ron Van Meter]] was murdered after obtaining evidence of drug trafficking within the department.[^1]

Walsh also provided [[Cheri Seymour]] with a significant piece of information regarding Judge [[Robert E. Coyle]]'s background, alleging that the Judge was once the attorney of record for Curry Company (owned by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]) in Yosemite National Park.[^1]
