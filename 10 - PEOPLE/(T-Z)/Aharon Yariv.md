Aharon Yariv was a Brigadier General and the head of military intelligence in [[Israel]]. He was one of the high-profile Israeli figures who took an interest in [[Uri Geller]]'s purported psychic abilities. Newspapers in Israel reported that Geller had met privately with Yariv[^1].

This meeting highlights the interest of Israeli intelligence in Geller's capabilities, similar to how other nations' intelligence agencies, including the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], explored the potential military and intelligence applications of [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]][^1].
