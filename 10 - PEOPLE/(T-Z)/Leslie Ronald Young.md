Leslie Ronald "Jimmy" Young was a veteran British broadcaster for [[BBC Radio 2]], known for his show *The Jimmy Young Show*, which had a wide audience across England, [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]][^1].

On November 23, 1973, Young conducted a live on-air experiment with [[Uri Geller]]. Young asked Geller to bend a large key. Geller concentrated, and encouraged listeners across the [[United Kingdom]] to summon their own [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] powers and bend metal in their homes. Live on national radio, Young exclaimed, "It’s bending right in front of me, I can’t believe it!"[^1].

Following the broadcast, the [[BBC]] switchboard was inundated with calls from citizens reporting metal objects in their homes inexplicably bending, and watches restarting. This event, which the [[CIA]] referred to as "secondary consequences," led many people across Great Britain to believe they had bent metal with their own minds[^1].
