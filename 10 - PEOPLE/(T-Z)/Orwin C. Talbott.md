Orwin C. Talbott was a Lieutenant General and deputy commander of the U.S. Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). In early 1974, Talbott visited [[Israel]] to discuss lessons learned from the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. During a meeting with [[David Elazar]], then Israeli Chief of Staff, Elazar suddenly began talking "out of the blue" about [[Israel]]'s threat to use nuclear weapons in the desperate moments of the 1973 war. Talbott understood the significance of this information and quickly filed a top-secret one-page memorandum for General [[Creighton W. Abrams]], the Army chief of staff, believing Elazar was trying to send a message to [[Washington D.C.]].[^1]
