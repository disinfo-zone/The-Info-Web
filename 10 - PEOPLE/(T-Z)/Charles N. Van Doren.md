Charles N. Van Doren was the deputy general counsel of the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] in the [[Richard M. Nixon|Nixon]] administration. He was convinced that [[Israel]] was the "Achilles heel" of [[America]]'s [[Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty|NPT]] policy, stating, "We were winking at it." Van Doren repeatedly tried to get the NPT on the agenda for talks on the [[Middle East]], but was told there was "too much on the table." He understood the underlying reason: an order had gone out that no nuclear information on Israeli proliferation was to be put out, which he found very frustrating.[^1]
