Patricia Wald was the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. She played a direct role in the events surrounding the non-reappointment of [[George Francis Bason, Jr.|Judge Bason]], which became a central point of contention in the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] due to allegations of improper influence by the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]].

On December 28, 1987, Chief Judge Wald informed Judge Bason of the Court's decision not to reappoint him. Subsequently, on January 12, 1988, Judge Bason sent a 14-page letter to Chief Judge Wald (with copies to every judge on the Court of Appeals), in which he raised the allegation that the DOJ may have obstructed his reappointment in retaliation for his rulings in the [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] case. This letter became a basis for the DOJ's motion to recuse Judge Bason from further proceedings in the [[INSLAW]] case.[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence that anyone tried to influence the selection process improperly. Chief Judge Wald unequivocally denied that the DOJ obstructed or attempted to obstruct the reappointment of Bankruptcy Judge Bason. The investigation concluded that the allegations of improper interference were not supported by credible evidence. The report notes that Judge Bason's allegation was made by himself, a disappointed candidate, and that the great weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that there was no attempt by the DOJ to obstruct his reappointment.[^1]
