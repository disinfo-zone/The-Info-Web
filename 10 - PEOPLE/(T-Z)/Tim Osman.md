[[Tim Osman]] was a figure involved in a worldwide support network for the [[Mujahideen]] in [[Afghanistan]]. He met with [[Ted Gunderson]], [[Ralph Olberg]], and [[Michael Riconosciuto]] in early 1986 to discuss this network, which focused on the Afghanistan Resistance Movement against the Soviets.[^1]

Discussions included the Mujahideen's willingness to field test new and esoteric weapons and return research reports with photos. They also discussed the capture and/or defection of high-ranking Soviet military personnel with sensitive compartmentalized information, and the availability of their briefings. Other topics included a military joint venture in [[Turkey]] to produce specialized ammunition and a lobbying effort to legally obtain Stinger II missiles and their variants.[^1]

[[Ralph Olberg]] and Osman proposed an unprecedented leadership meeting in Washington D.C. to prove that their group represented the full leadership of the Mujahideen, addressing a "turf battle problem" with certain factions of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and their group, MSH (Management Science For Health).[^1]
