Tang Yu was a twelve-year-old boy in [[China]] who, in 1979, was reported to be able to read with his ears. His case, which was publicized in the *Sichuan Daily*, sparked the [[Extraordinary Powers Craze]], a period of intense interest in paranormal phenomena in China.[^1]

Tang Yu's alleged ability to perceive written words through his ears was investigated by local and provincial officials, and eventually by the national Science Commission in Beijing. He was one of the first individuals to be identified as possessing [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF), and his case played a key role in the Chinese government's decision to officially sanction research into these phenomena.[^1]
