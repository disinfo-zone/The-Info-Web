Don Walsh is a renowned deep-sea explorer and former naval officer, known for achieving the deepest dive ever undertaken. In 1960, along with a crewmate, he descended to the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean, a feat that would not be replicated for another fifty-two years[^1].

In the fall of 1976, Walsh, along with fellow deep-sea explorer [[Don Keach]], was running the Institute for Marine and Coastal Studies at the [[University of Southern California]]. They provided [[Stephan Schwartz]] with access to the *Taurus I*, a state-of-the-art submersible, for three days of sea trials. This access was crucial for Schwartz's [[Project Deep Quest]], which aimed to use [[Remote Viewing]] to locate a previously unknown shipwreck on the seafloor[^1].
