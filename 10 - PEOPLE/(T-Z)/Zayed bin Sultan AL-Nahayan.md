Zayed bin Sultan AL-Nahayan was the Head of [[Abu Dhabi]]'s ruling family and president of the [[United Arab Emirates]].[^1]

### Early Life and Ascension

Zayed's early life was described by explorer Wilfred Thesiger, who noted his powerful build and reputation among the Bedouin. He was involved in the *ghazzu*, or Bedouin raid, to secure territory or camels. Zayed's passion was falconing. In 1966, Zayed deposed and exiled his brother, Shakhbut bin Sultan AL-Nahayan, and ascended to the throne of Abu Dhabi.[^2]

### Relationship with BCCI and Abedi

[[Agha Hasan Abedi]] cultivated a relationship with Zayed, recognizing the potential of Abu Dhabi's oil wealth.[^3] Abedi's persistence led to Zayed becoming a key supporter and later owner of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^4] Zayed's petrodollars were pumped into Abedi's bank, and BCCI handled the purchase of homes for Zayed in [[Pakistan]] and managed details of his trips.[^4]

BCCI effectively merged with Zayed's Private Department, which handled and invested the Emirates' wealth.[^5] Zayed was the principal mark in Abedi's con game, having been coddled into pumping $1.5 billion in new capital and another $1.5 billion in deposits into BCCI since mid-1990.[^6]

### Role in BCCI Scandal

Zayed and his chief lieutenant, [[Ghanim Fan's al-Mazrui]], were infuriated by the global seizure of BCCI, as it occurred just ten days before a deal to restructure the bank was to be signed.[^6] Zayed's various state agencies, along with Zayed himself, lost as much as $8 billion in the shutdown of BCCI.[^7]

He ordered audits of BCCI, which revealed billions of dollars missing.[^8] The [[Bank of England]] tried to persuade Zayed to inject more money into BCCI to cover losses.[^9]
