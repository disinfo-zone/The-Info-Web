Colonel [[Reuben Yirador]] was a department commander in [[Unit 8200]], an [[Israel|Israeli]] Signals Intelligence (Sigint) unit. He was later replaced by [[Sasson Yishaek|Lt. Col. Sasson Yishaek]] as commander of the department, but remained in [[Israeli Military Intelligence]].[^1]

In 1972, [[Reuben Yirador|Yirador]] was involved in a significant discovery when he decoded a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intercept (VENONA) that revealed the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] were bugging the office of [[Golda Meir]], then Prime Minister of [[Israel]]. This discovery, along with [[Golda Meir|Meir's]] meeting with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and her rejection of a peace settlement, informed [[Anwar Sadat]] and may have prompted the 1973 war.[^1]
