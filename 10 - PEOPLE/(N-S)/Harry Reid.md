[[Harry Reid]] was a United States Senator from Nevada who served as the Senate Majority Leader. He was a pivotal figure in the establishment and funding of the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and a staunch supporter of the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) disclosure movement until his death in 2021.[^1]

### Interest in UAP

Senator Reid's interest in the UAP topic was sparked by his position as the senator for Nevada, the home of the highly classified [[Area 51]] military installation. This, combined with his friendship with aerospace magnate and paranormal researcher [[Robert Bigelow]], led him to take the issue seriously. He was known on Capitol Hill as a "bulldog in a pit of vipers," and his determination was crucial in overcoming the stigma and bureaucratic inertia surrounding the UAP issue.[^1]

### Funding for AATIP

In 2007, Senator Reid, along with Senators [[Ted Stevens]] of Alaska and [[Daniel Inouye]] of Hawaii, secured $22 million in funding for the [[Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program]] (AAWSAP), the precursor to AATIP. These three men controlled congressional spending for "black budget" Pentagon programs, and their bipartisan support was essential for the program's creation. Reid continued to be a champion for the program, later securing an additional $10 million in funding for AATIP, though the funds were ultimately diverted to another program.[^1]

### Support for Disclosure

Even after leaving the Senate, Reid remained a powerful advocate for UAP disclosure. He publicly confirmed his role in funding AATIP and vouched for the credibility of [[Luis Elizondo]] after his resignation from the Pentagon. He provided crucial support for the 2017 New York Times article that broke the story of AATIP, and he continued to brief members of Congress and the media on the importance of the UAP issue. His steadfast support was a key factor in the passage of the historic UAP legislation in the 2021 and 2022 National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs).[^1]
