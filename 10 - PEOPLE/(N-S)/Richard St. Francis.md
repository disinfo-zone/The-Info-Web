In April 1989, [[Richard St. Francis|St. Francis]] was involved in a deal to sell three C-130s to [[Iran|Tehran]], working with [[Joseph O'Toole]] and [[Mike Timpani]].

He was also the person who brought the mysterious "Lettner" (later identified as [[John Lisica]], an undercover [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]] agent) to [[Kennedy Airport]] to meet [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], as part of a sting operation.[^1]

[[Richard St. Francis|St. Francis]] was arrested in April 1989 and later indicted for conspiracy to defraud the [[USA|United States]], cover up illegal dealings, and attempt to sell three planes to [[Iran]] in violation of federal laws.
