[[Eduard Naumov]] was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] parapsychologist. At a conference in Moscow in 1968, Naumov announced to Western researchers that the Red Navy had successfully replicated the entire [[The Nautilus (Telepathy Project)|Nautilus experiment]] using one of its own submarines. He further claimed that Soviet military researchers had developed a method for telepathically tapping into other people's psychic communications.[^1]

Naumov's claims, along with other "wild stories" from Soviet psi research, were later featured in the 1970 book *Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain* by [[Sheila Ostrander]] and [[Lynn Schroeder]]. While some of his assertions were met with skepticism, his work contributed to the growing concern within the U.S. intelligence community about a potential "psi gap" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Naumov was also interested in "Kirlian photography" of human "biofields" and believed in the influence of sunspots on destiny, which led some at the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to view his work as influenced by mystical beliefs.[^1]
