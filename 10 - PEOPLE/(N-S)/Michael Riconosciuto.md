[[Michael Riconosciuto]] is a computer scientist and self-proclaimed former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] asset, known for his involvement in various clandestine operations and his claims regarding the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]]. He was described as a child prodigy, wiring his parents' neighborhood with a private telephone system at age 10 and winning science fairs with laser technology, leading to a summer research assistantship at Stanford's Cooper Vaper Laser Laboratory.[^1]

### Involvement with Wackenhut and Cabazon Joint Venture

From 1981 to 1984, Riconosciuto served as the Director of Research for a joint venture between [[Wackenhut Corporation]] and the [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians|Cabazon Indian tribe]] near Indio, California. This venture, known as "[[Cabazon Arms]]," aimed to develop and manufacture military and national security materials, including night vision goggles, machine guns, fuel-air explosives, and biological and chemical warfare weapons. The sovereign status of the reservation was utilized to bypass stringent federal controls on such developments.[^1]

During this period, Riconosciuto claimed to have modified the proprietary [[PROMIS]] computer software. He stated that [[Earl Brian]] made the software available to him through Wackenhut, after acquiring it from [[Peter Videnieks]], a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] contracting official. Riconosciuto's modifications were intended to facilitate the worldwide implementation of PROMIS in law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including specific adaptations for the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] and the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|CSIS]] in [[Canada]]. This alleged modification and sale of pirated PROMIS software became a central element of the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]].[^1]

However, the Special Counsel's investigation found significant inconsistencies in Riconosciuto's various accounts of his role in the alleged theft of PROMIS. He was inconsistent regarding from whom he received the software and when and where he altered it. For instance, in his affidavit, he claimed to have received a single copy of the software from Earl Brian, while at his trial, he claimed to have received three versions from [[John Philip Nichols]]. His timeline for altering the software also varied, with his affidavit stating 1983-1984, but his trial testimony indicating late 1981 to early 1983. The investigation noted that it would have been physically impossible for anyone from the DOJ to provide an enhanced version of PROMIS in late 1981, as Inslaw did not even enter into the implementation contract until March 1982, and the enhanced version was not delivered until April 1983.[^2]

Both Earl Brian and Peter Videnieks categorically denied Riconosciuto's allegations, stating they had never met him or each other, and had never been to Indio, California. The investigation found both Brian and Videnieks to be credible witnesses. Furthermore, the investigation found no evidence to corroborate Riconosciuto's claims of computer equipment or software modification activities at the Cabazon reservation. Witnesses, including the Tribal Chairman Art Welmas and Indio Police Chief Sam Cross, stated they never saw large computers or computer facilities on the reservation during that period. The investigation concluded that Riconosciuto was a "totally unreliable witness" and that his story was a "tale of total fiction woven against the background of accurate historical facts."[^2]

### The PROMIS Affidavit and Arrest

In March 1991, Riconosciuto provided an affidavit to [[Bill Hamilton]] and [[Nancy Hamilton]], owners of [[INSLAW]], detailing his role in modifying PROMIS and alleging that [[Peter Videnieks]] attempted to dissuade him from cooperating with a [[United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] investigation into the software's theft. Eight days after signing this affidavit, Riconosciuto was arrested for allegedly operating a methamphetamine lab in Tacoma, Washington. He claimed this arrest was a deliberate attempt to discredit his testimony. The Special Counsel's investigation, however, found no connection between Riconosciuto's prosecution and his allegations in the Inslaw matter, concluding that the drug case began as a local investigation and the evidence against him was overwhelming.[^1][^2]

### Connections and Allegations

Riconosciuto's network of connections and the scope of his alleged activities are extensive. He was closely associated with [[Robert Booth Nichols]], a key figure in [[Danny Casolaro]]'s "[[The Octopus]]" investigation. They were partners in Meridian Arms, a subsidiary of Meridian International Logistics (MIL), and Riconosciuto was a technical advisor for [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]], where Nichols was on the Board of Directors. Riconosciuto claimed Nichols was involved in large-scale illegal drug operations and money laundering, and that Nichols attempted to pressure him into illegal activities.[^1]

Riconosciuto claimed to have provided valuable intelligence to former Assistant U.S. Attorney [[Brian Leighton]] regarding a drug/arms organization known as "[[The Company]]," which consisted of former military, law enforcement, and intelligence personnel involved in drug trafficking, gunrunning, and mercenary operations.[^1]

He also claimed participation in a [[National Security Council|NSC]]-sanctioned drug/sting operation in Lebanon through Euramae Trading Company in Nicosia, Cyprus, another alleged NSC cutout. He described a network involving [[Michael T. Hurley]] (DEA Country Attache), [[Maurice Ghanem]], and [[George Pender]], where heroin shipments were allegedly used to fund intelligence operations and were sometimes diverted for profit.[^1]

Riconosciuto claimed to have handled gold transfers, money laundering, "virtual dead drops," and altered ACH daily reconciliations for various underworld figures, including [[Robert Booth Nichols]], [[Gilbert Rodriguez]], and [[Jose Londono]] of the [[Cali Drug Cartel]]. He sought to provide this information to the [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network|FinCen]] in exchange for witness protection.[^1]

Regarding the [[October Surprise]], Riconosciuto claimed that he and [[Earl Brian]] traveled to [[Iran]] in 1980 and paid $40 million to Iranian officials to delay the release of U.S. hostages until after [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidential inauguration, linking the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] to the [[October Surprise]] affair.[^1] However, the Special Counsel's investigation found no credible evidence to support this claim, and evidence suggested Brian was in New York at the time of the alleged Iran trip.[^2]

Riconosciuto claimed to have been in direct communication with [[Michael Hand]], co-founder of [[Nugan Hand Bank]], before and after Hand's disappearance, and handled money transfers for Hand when he fled [[Australia]].[^1]

Beyond PROMIS, Riconosciuto was involved in advanced technological projects, including theoretical work on railguns for the U.S. Army, and research into "energy transfer phenomena" with [[William Frash]] and [[Patrick Moriarty]] (his father's business partner), aiming to develop technology that would "supercede all existing world patents in the field."[^1]

### Legal Troubles and Witness Protection Attempts

Following his arrest, Riconosciuto attempted multiple times to trade information with federal authorities, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|BATF]], in exchange for entry into a Witness Protection Program. He offered to expose high-level corruption, drug trafficking, and money laundering operations, including those involving [[Robert Booth Nichols]], [[Michael Abbell]], and the [[Cali Drug Cartel]]. However, these attempts were largely unsuccessful, with authorities often expressing skepticism or facing internal resistance to his claims.[^1]

### Relationship with Danny Casolaro

[[Danny Casolaro]] began interviewing Riconosciuto prior to his arrest in March 1991. Riconosciuto became a key source for Casolaro's "[[The Octopus]]" investigation, providing insights into the alleged criminal network. Riconosciuto claimed that Casolaro's death occurred shortly after he began investigating [[Michael Abbell]]'s connection to the [[Cali Drug Cartel]], a lead Riconosciuto had provided. He also stated that [[Robert Booth Nichols]] had warned Casolaro to stay away from Riconosciuto.[^1]
