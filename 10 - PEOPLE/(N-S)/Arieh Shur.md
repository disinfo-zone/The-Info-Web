Colonel [[Arieh Shur]] was an officer in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defense Forces]]' External Relations Department. He provided a letter of recommendation for [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], confirming Ben-Menashe's service in a task that demanded "considerable analytical and executive skills." The letter noted Ben-Menashe's ability to carry out his task with "understanding, skill, and determination," and to adapt to changing situations.[^1]

This letter was later introduced as evidence during [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe's]] trial to counter the [[Israel|Israeli]] government's claim that he was merely a low-level translator.[^1]
