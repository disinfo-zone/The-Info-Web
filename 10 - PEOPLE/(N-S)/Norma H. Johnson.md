Norma H. Johnson was a District Judge who chaired the Merit Selection Panel responsible for reviewing candidates for the bankruptcy judge position in the District of Columbia. This panel was formed in 1987, prior to the expiration of [[George Francis Bason, Jr.|Judge Bason]]'s term.

Judge Johnson became a central figure in the allegations surrounding Judge Bason's non-reappointment. She solicited her colleagues' views of Judge Bason and it was during this process that Judge Bason ruled orally that the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] had stolen and converted [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s software. Judge Johnson initially recalled that a district judge recommended she obtain a copy of the transcript of Judge Bason's oral ruling in Inslaw. She later clarified that it was District Court Judge [[Royce Lambreth]] who directed her to Bason's ruling. Although Lambreth did not comment on the ruling, Judge Johnson understood from his tone that he viewed the ruling unfavorably. She circulated copies of Judge Bason's oral ruling to the Panel members, the only judicial opinion circulated. While the Panel discussed the ruling, they reportedly found nothing untoward about it and agreed it should not influence their evaluation of Judge Bason.[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence that anyone tried to influence the selection process improperly. It concluded that [[Royce Lambreth]]'s communication with Judge Johnson was proper, as he had a legitimate interest in the matter as a prospective judicial officer. The report noted that Judge Johnson was fiercely independent and that any attempts to influence her had little effect. She considered the [[INSLAW]] ruling along with all other information the Panel received. The Special Counsel's report concluded that the great weight of the evidence clearly supports the conclusion that there was no attempt by the DOJ to obstruct Judge Bason's reappointment.[^1]
