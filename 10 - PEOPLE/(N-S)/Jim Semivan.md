[[Jim Semivan]] is a retired senior member of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s (CIA) Senior Intelligence Service and a key figure in the modern [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) disclosure movement. With a 25-year career in the CIA, he has leveraged his experience and connections to help bring the UAP issue to the forefront.[^1]

### CIA Career

Semivan joined the CIA in 1982 and served for twenty-five years, retiring in 2007 as a member of the Senior Intelligence Service. He served multiple overseas and domestic tours and held senior management positions at CIA headquarters. He is a recipient of the Agencyâ€™s Career Intelligence Medal.[^1]

### Role in UAP Disclosure

After his retirement, Semivan remained involved in the intelligence community as a contractor. He was instrumental in connecting [[Christopher Mellon]] with [[Luis Elizondo]] in early 2017, a meeting that would prove to be a pivotal moment in the UAP disclosure effort. Semivan vouched for Mellon to Elizondo and his team, and he later vouched for Elizondo to Mellon, helping to build the trust that was necessary for them to work together.[^1]

Semivan was also a key figure in the formation of [[To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science]] (TTSA), the organization founded by Tom DeLonge to investigate and publicize the UAP issue. He was part of the initial group of former government officials who joined TTSA, and he worked to recruit Elizondo into the organization after his resignation from the Pentagon.[^1]

Semivan is a firm believer in the reality of the UAP phenomenon, stating, "There is a nonhuman intelligence that is living with us on this planet. . . . We are not alone, and we never have been."[^1]
