[[Oliver North]] was a Lieutenant Colonel in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and a central figure in the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. He was implicated in various covert operations, including arms dealing and alleged drug profits.[^1]

North was alleged to have received drug profits from [[Monzer Al-Kassar]], a Syrian kingpin and arms dealer, to purchase arms for the Nicaraguan [[Contras]]. The [[United States]] Tower Commission probe into Iran-gate revealed that Al-Kassar had been paid $1.2 million by North's co-conspirator General [[Richard Secord]] to move weapons from [[Israel]] to the [[Contras]].[^1]

[[Bill Turner]], a friend and confidante of [[Danny Casolaro]], claimed to have seen papers from Casolaro that connected North and the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]]. North's personal notebooks documenting the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] also contained [[Ian Stuart Spiro]]'s name.[^1]
