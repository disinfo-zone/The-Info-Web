Paige refused outside help in the search for Van Meter, including additional divers from adjacent counties and a mini-submarine offered by [[Dave Beavers]]' associate.[^1]

Paige confronted [[Ron Van Meter]] after Van Meter reported drug dealing and corruption within the Mariposa Sheriff's Department to the [[California Attorney General's Office|Attorney General's office]] in Sacramento. Paige had received a call from the Attorney General informing him of Van Meter's visit and its contents, and was reportedly "livid" about Van Meter's actions.[^1]
