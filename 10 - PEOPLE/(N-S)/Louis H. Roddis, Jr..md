Louis H. Roddis, Jr. played a major role in [[America]]'s postwar nuclear weapons development. He was a member of the Nuclear Intelligence Panel (NIP). Roddis concluded that the 1979 [[South Africa]]n-Israeli nuclear test had taken place on a barge or on one of the islands in the South Indian Ocean archipelago. He expressed anger at [[Frank Press]] and the White House for what he saw as a deliberate effort to downplay and manipulate the facts surrounding the event.[^1]
