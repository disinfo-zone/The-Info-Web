Karlis Osis was a Latvian-born parapsychologist with a PhD, known for his research into deathbed visions and his work with the U.S. government on [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] experiments with animals[^1][^2].

In the 1940s, Osis conducted a four-year study on deathbed visions, interviewing thousands of doctors and nurses in America and northern [[India]]. He hypothesized that Indian patients, whose belief system allows for reincarnation, were far more likely to experience visions before death than American patients[^2].

He later worked at [[J. B. Rhine]]'s [[Duke University Parapsychology Laboratory]], where he conducted classified ESP tests with cats for the [[Department of Defense]] in the early 1950s. This study was designed to determine whether man could communicate telepathically with a cat[^2].

Later, as the director of research at the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in [[New York City]], Osis worked with [[Ingo Swann]] on a series of experiments purported to involve [[Out-of-Body Experience|out-of-body experiences]] (OBEs), also known as traveling [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyance]]. In these experiments, Swann was wired to a Beckman Dynograph and asked to "float up out-of-the-body" to spy on objects hidden on suspended trays. Osis and his assistant, [[Janet Mitchell]], were reportedly thrilled with the results, particularly when Swann drew what he saw instead of trying to articulate it[^2].

Osis also conducted a [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]] experiment with [[Pat Price]], where Price, from a distance, appeared to affect an infrared sensor in a sealed copper box[^1].
