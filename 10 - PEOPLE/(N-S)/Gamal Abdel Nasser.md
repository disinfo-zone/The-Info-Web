[[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] (1918â€“1970) was the second President of [[Egypt]], serving from 1956 until his death in 1970. He was a prominent figure in Arab nationalism and a key leader in the non-aligned movement during the [[Cold War]].[^1]

**Rise to Power and Pan-Arab Vision**

Nasser emerged as premier in 1954 after the overthrow of [[King Farouk]] in 1952. His ambitious talk of Pan-Arabism rattled the Israelis, who instinctively turned to the [[United States]] for support in response to this growing regional challenge.[^2]

**Shift Toward Soviet Alliance**

The trajectory of Nasser's foreign policy took a decisive turn following escalating tensions with [[Israel]]. After the Israeli attack on an Egyptian military camp at [[Gaza]] in February 1955, Nasser responded by turning to the Communist world for military aid. His efforts to secure alternative sources of support proved fruitful when he received a promise from [[Chou En-lai]], the Chinese premier, for arms at the Bandung Conference of African and Asian nations in April 1955.[^2]

This initial outreach to the Communist bloc soon expanded dramatically. In July 1955, Soviet delegations arrived in [[Cairo]] to offer military aid, and by September, Nasser announced that [[Egypt]] would receive a staggering total of 200 modern Soviet bombers, 230 tanks, 200 troop carriers, and over 500 artillery pieces, along with Soviet advisers. This massive arms deal fundamentally altered the military balance in the Middle East.[^2]

**The Suez Crisis**

Building on his growing confidence and Soviet backing, Nasser made his most audacious move in July 1956 when he nationalized the [[Suez Canal]]. This bold action brought the British government into secret planning for war with [[Israel]] and [[France]], setting the stage for the 1956 Suez Crisis that would define his presidency and cement his status as a leader of the developing world.[^2]

**American Intelligence Connections**

Throughout these tumultuous events, Nasser maintained complex relationships with Western intelligence figures. [[Miles Copeland]], a retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer, was a good friend of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]]. [[Miles Copeland|Copeland]] was believed by [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence to be responsible for [[USA|U.S.]] pressure on [[Israel]], [[Britain]], and [[France]] to withdraw from the [[Suez Canal]] area in 1956, and for pushing [[Israel|Israelis]] to withdraw from the [[Sinai Desert|Sinai]].[^2]

**Death and Unusual Predictions**

Nasser's political career came to an abrupt end when he purportedly collapsed with a stroke while giving a speech, leading to his death on September 28, 1970.[^2] Remarkably, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser's]] death was notably predicted by [[Uri Geller|Israeli psychic Uri Geller]] during a [[Telepathy|telepathy]] demonstration in [[Tel Aviv]]. Geller, who became physically ill during the performance, proclaimed that [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] "had just died or is about to die." Twenty minutes later, [[Radio Cairo]] announced [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser's]] death from a heart attack.[^1]

This extraordinary event significantly boosted [[Uri Geller|Geller's]] reputation in [[Israel]], with [[Golda Meir|Prime Minister Golda Meir]] reportedly quipping, "Don't ask me... Ask [[Uri Geller]]" when asked about [[Israel|Israel's]] future. Nasser's successor was [[Anwar Sadat]], who would chart a dramatically different course for Egyptian foreign policy.[^1][^2]
