Garry Nolan is a leading research scientist at [[Stanford University]], specializing in genetics, immunology, and bioinformatics. He trained under Nobel Prize-winning biologist [[David Baltimore]] and has published over 200 research papers and holds twenty biotechnology patents[^1].

Nolan is collaborating with [[Kit Green]] on a research project to study individuals who have experienced enigmatic injuries, such as burns, skin lesions, and cancers, and who have also had face-to-face encounters with [[Unidentified Aerial Phenomena|UAPs]]. Nolan has met and worked with many of Green's patients and confirmed that they were injured, observing physiological consequences of the harm they endured[^1].

Nolan and Green believe that in many cases, the injuries appear to be caused by an electromagnetic field. They are working on both the genetic and epigenetic components of these injuries, using advanced mapping technology to analyze the patients' [[DNA]] and immune systems. Their goal is to find patterns among the patients and create an integrated theory, suggesting a potential genetic determinant for these experiences[^1].

Nolan's lab is known for pioneering advances in large-scale mapping of cellular features and human cells. He believes that the immune system records every event that happens to a person, creating a biological database of their physiological life. This technology could eventually allow doctors to read a person's historical physiological record from a blood sample[^1].

Nolan speculates that some people may repeatedly attract these phenomena or experiences, acting like an "antenna" or "lighthouses in the dark." He and Green are essentially searching for a gene for paranormality, or what Green prefers to call "the genomics of supernormality"[^1].

### Role in AATIP Research

Dr. Nolan's expertise has made him a key figure in the scientific investigation of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) and their biological effects. He was brought into the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) investigation by Dr. William "Will" Livingston, the program's medical consultant, to analyze MRI images of the brains of UAP experiencers. These individuals, many of whom were military and intelligence officials, had suffered a range of medical issues following their encounters with UAP. Dr. Nolan confirmed that the patients had suffered brain scarring, or "white-matter disease."[^2]

More significantly, Dr. Nolan discovered that all 105 of the patients in the initial study group had an overdeveloped area of the brain known as the caudate-putamen. This region is associated with intuition, and Dr. Nolan theorized that individuals with this enhanced structure may be like "organic supercomputers," able to process information and perceive things that others cannot. This led to the hypothesis that the caudate-putamen may act as an "antenna" for psychic abilities and may even be a factor in attracting UAP encounters.[^2]

Further research revealed that many of the individuals in the study group had been involved in the [[Stargate Project]] and were trained in [[Remote Viewing]]. Dr. Nolan also discovered a correlation between the enhanced caudate-putamen and Native American DNA, specifically Cherokee blood, which was present in almost all of the experiencers and even many of the members of the AATIP team itself.[^2]

### Analysis of UAP Materials

Dr. Nolan has also been involved in the analysis of alleged UAP materials. He and the French scientist [[Jacques Vall√©e]] collaborated on a paper analyzing a metallic slag recovered from a 1977 UAP crash in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Their analysis revealed that the material contained isotopes of magnesium and iron that were arranged in a highly structured and deliberate manner, a feat that is beyond our current technological capabilities.[^2]
