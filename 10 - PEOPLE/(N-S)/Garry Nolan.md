Garry Nolan is a leading research scientist at [[Stanford University]], specializing in genetics, immunology, and bioinformatics. He trained under Nobel Prize-winning biologist [[David Baltimore]] and has published over 200 research papers and holds twenty biotechnology patents[^1].

Nolan is collaborating with [[Kit Green]] on a research project to study individuals who have experienced enigmatic injuries, such as burns, skin lesions, and cancers, and who have also had face-to-face encounters with [[Unidentified Aerial Phenomena|UAPs]]. Nolan has met and worked with many of Green's patients and confirmed that they were injured, observing physiological consequences of the harm they endured[^1].

Nolan and Green believe that in many cases, the injuries appear to be caused by an electromagnetic field. They are working on both the genetic and epigenetic components of these injuries, using advanced mapping technology to analyze the patients' [[DNA]] and immune systems. Their goal is to find patterns among the patients and create an integrated theory, suggesting a potential genetic determinant for these experiences[^1].

Nolan's lab is known for pioneering advances in large-scale mapping of cellular features and human cells. He believes that the immune system records every event that happens to a person, creating a biological database of their physiological life. This technology could eventually allow doctors to read a person's historical physiological record from a blood sample[^1].

Nolan speculates that some people may repeatedly attract these phenomena or experiences, acting like an "antenna" or "lighthouses in the dark." He and Green are essentially searching for a gene for paranormality, or what Green prefers to call "the genomics of supernormality"[^1].
