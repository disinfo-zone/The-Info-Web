[[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso]] was the founder and leader of the [[Shining Path]] (El Sendero Luminoso), a Maoist terrorist group in [[Peru]]. He was formerly a professor of philosophy at the [[University of San Cristobal]] at [[Ayacucho]], where he was considered a legendary figure by his followers, who saw him as the "fourth sword of Marxism" after [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].[^1]

In 1980, [[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] proclaimed the armed struggle against the capitalist government in [[Lima]], and the [[Shining Path]] grew into a powerful force, leading to the declaration of martial law in the department of [[Ayacucho]] by [[Alan Garcia|Peruvian President Alan Garcia]].[^1]

In 1988, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] traveled to [[Peru]] on a secret mission for [[Yitzhak Shamir]] to secure the purchase of rare minerals for [[Israel|Israel's]] nuclear program. [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] met [[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] at a farmhouse in [[Shining Path]]-controlled territory. [[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] was initially suspicious of [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe]], but was impressed by his directness. He revealed his own Jewish heritage and discussed his philosophy, which blended Inca and kibbutz ideology, and his views on equality and family.[^1]

[[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] agreed to sell the minerals to [[Israel]] for $10 million, to be deposited in a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank account. He also requested that [[Israel]] purchase a chain of five small newspapers, the [[Ocho Group]], on the movement's behalf, and provide medical equipment to be brought on the [[Cessna]]s transporting the minerals.[^1]

[[Abimael Guzmán Reynoso|Guzmán]] was rumored to have died of cancer in 1990, but he continued to lead the [[Shining Path]]. He was captured in 1992 and was imprisoned.[^1]
