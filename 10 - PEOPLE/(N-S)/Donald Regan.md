Donald Regan served as the [[Treasury Department|Treasury Secretary]] during the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]].[^1]
### Role in BCCI Scandal

In January 1985, Regan received a [[CIA]] report on the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]]'s secret ownership of [[First American Bank]] through [[Douglas Mulholland]], the intelligence liaison at the Treasury Department.[^2] Despite receiving this information, Regan did not take action.[^3]

Regan later refused to be interviewed by [[Jonathan Beaty]] in early 1992, stating that his memory about the BCCI affair was not good.[^2]
