[[Rodolfo Stange]] was a General and chief of the Chilean Carabineros (paramilitary police). He was a significant figure in the Chilean government during the period of [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet's]] rule and was involved in the country's arms trade and intelligence operations.[^1]

[[Rodolfo Stange|Stange]] was present at a meeting in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], in late 1986, with [[Carlos Cardoen]], [[Robert Gates]], Senator [[John Tower]], and [[Pieter Van Der Westhuizen|Gen. Pieter Van Der Westhuizen]] (South African Military Intelligence). At this meeting, [[USA|U.S.]] officials reaffirmed their intention to maintain arms channels to [[Iraq]] through [[South Africa]] and [[Chile]].[^1]

In September 1988, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] met with [[Rodolfo Stange|Stange]] in [[Chile]] to discuss [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen's]] chemical trade with [[Iraq]]. [[Rodolfo Stange|Stange]] initially expressed concern about the trade but also indicated his loyalty to [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] and his own political ambitions. He was aware of the [[USA|U.S.]] backing for [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen's]] activities. [[Rodolfo Stange|Stange]] invited [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe]] to dinner, where [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen]] and [[Mark Thatcher]] were also present, a meeting that appeared to be staged to demonstrate Cardoen's connections.[^1]

[[Rodolfo Stange|Stange]] was a key figure in the Chilean government's response to [[Israel|Israeli]] pressure to halt arms sales to [[Iraq]]. He was also involved in the plot to overthrow [[Alfredo Stroessner|President Stroessner]] in [[Paraguay]], aligning with [[Andres Rodriguez|Gen. Andres Rodriguez]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. He had presidential aspirations in [[Chile]] following [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet's]] defeat in the plebiscite.[^1]
