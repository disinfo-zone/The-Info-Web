Ed Rogers was the chief of Staff D (later known as the Office of SIGINT Operations) at the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], an office specializing in small-scale signals intelligence (SIGINT) collection. He was a key figure in the internal debates within the CIA regarding the use of psychic intelligence, or [[PSI-INT]].[^1]

Rogers was highly skeptical of incorporating psychic data into high-stakes operations, primarily due to what he termed the "giggle factor"â€”the fear of ridicule and operational compromise if it became widely known that his office was consulting psychics. This skepticism was evident when [[Norm Everheart]] proposed using [[Pat Price]]'s remote viewing abilities to confirm the layout of a Chinese Embassy basement.[^1]

Despite Price's impressive performance in three preliminary tests, accurately describing details of the Chinese Embassy in Africa and a consular building in Rome, Rogers ultimately decided against using psychic intelligence for the operation. He famously stated, "It may be the only opportunity we ever have to find something at ground level... I'm not going to screw it up by reading tea leaves." In the end, Rogers approved a risky operation using conventional technical means to check the targeted embassy's basement, which concluded it was only a wine cellar, not a communications office.[^1]
