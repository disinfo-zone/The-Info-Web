[[Sarah McClendon]] was a [[White House]] correspondent and a close friend of [[Paul Wilcher]]. She wrote in her *Washington Report* on July 4, 1993, an article entitled "Death of a Friend," expressing her belief that Wilcher was a "casualty of good citizenship and patriotism."[^1]

McClendon had alerted authorities that Wilcher was missing. She was present at the scene after Wilcher's death but was unable to identify his body after viewing the remains. She was told that preliminary autopsy results found "no natural cause of death, and no other cause of death" to explain Wilcher's demise, despite him being in apparent good health.[^1]

McClendon called local police for 24 hours, imploring them to check on Wilcher. She attempted to get possession of the papers and tapes he left behind, but his family took them away. She believed Wilcher was a political prisoner, persecuted because he allegedly flew former President [[George Bush]] to [[Paris]] to meet with Iranians to make a deal to supply [[Iran]] with weapons in exchange for keeping American hostages until after the November election, ensuring [[Ronald Reagan]]'s victory.[^1]

McClendon was also present when [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents arrived at Wilcher's apartment. She checked their identification, which seemed convincing. She later phoned the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to ask about the presence of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents, and [[James V. Desarno, Jr.]], Assistant Special Agent in Charge from the D.C. Metropolitan Office, arrived. Desarno strongly denied that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was interested in or involved in the case, despite the presence of multiple agents.[^1]

McClendon petitioned [[Dr. Joye Carter]] of the D.C. Medical Examiner's office to submit forensic evidence from Wilcher's body fluids for further study, as the inconclusive autopsy results raised concerns. She also expressed her desire to submit the evidence to [[Dr. Mason]], a top forensic toxicologist.[^1]
