[[Sheikh Mussa Sadr]] was a Shi'ite leader from southern [[Lebanon]]. He disappeared on a visit to [[Libya]] in 1978. The [[Libya|Libyans]] were believed to have killed him for preaching Shi'ite [[Islam]] rather than their own brand of the religion.[^1]

His disappearance became a point of contention during [[Abdul Salam Jalloud|Maj. Abdul Salam Jalloud's]] visit to [[Iran]] after the [[Iranian Revolution]], with [[Iran|Iranian]] hosts demanding an explanation from [[Muammar Qaddafi|Col. Qaddafi's]] right-hand man.[^1]
