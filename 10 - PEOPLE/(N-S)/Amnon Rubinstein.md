Amnon Rubinstein was a prominent [[Israel|Israeli]] legal scholar, politician, and television talk show host. Known as the founding father of Israeli constitutional law, he served in various ministerial roles, including Minister of Communications, Minister of Science and Technology and Space, and Minister of Energy and Infrastructure[^1].

Rubinstein became a notable supporter of [[Uri Geller]]'s [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]] abilities since 1969. He first encountered Geller at a party, where Geller allegedly demonstrated a remarkable ability to influence Rubinstein's thoughts, making him choose a specific number that Geller had already written down. Rubinstein, initially skeptical, was astonished by this demonstration[^1].

He conducted numerous informal tests with Geller in his own home, where Geller consistently demonstrated the ability to "plant a thought right in our mind," such as writing down a number or a capital city that Rubinstein or his family would then choose. Rubinstein considered this ability far more significant than spoon bending, stating, "This is a single phenomenon that casts doubt on many of the foundations of our rational world." He remained a staunch defender of Geller's powers against critics[^1].

Rubinstein advised Geller to go to America to be tested at a serious research institute like [[Stanford Research Institute|Stanford]], which ultimately led to Geller's testing by the CIA[^1].
