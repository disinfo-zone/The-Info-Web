Qian Xuesen, also known as H. S. Tsien, was a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist who made significant contributions to the U.S. missile and space programs before being deported to [[China]] during the McCarthy era. He is considered the father of the Chinese rocket program.[^1]

In his later years, Qian became a vocal advocate for research into [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF), a term used in China to describe a range of paranormal abilities. He believed that the study of [[qigong]] and other traditional Chinese practices could lead to a scientific revolution and provide [[China]] with a strategic advantage. His influence was instrumental in the Chinese government's decision to officially sanction and fund research into these phenomena.[^1]
