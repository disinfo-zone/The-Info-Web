Ian Smart was a young British diplomat who served as third secretary of the British embassy in [[Tel Aviv]] in the late 1950s. He later became an international expert in nonproliferation. During his time in [[Israel]], he became curious and suspicious about the activities at [[Dimona]]. By the end of 1960, he was reporting his "suspicion" that the site looked like a nuclear reactor, prompted by its visible progress and the palpable French presence in [[Beersheba]].[^1]
