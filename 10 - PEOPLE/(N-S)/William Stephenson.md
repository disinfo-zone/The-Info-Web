Sir William Stephenson (1896â€“1989), famously known as "Intrepid" by [[Winston Churchill]], was a Canadian intelligence officer who headed [[British Intelligence]]'s operational arm in America, the [[British Security Coordination Office]]. This office was disguised as part of the British Passport Control Office in Rockefeller Center, [[New York City]][^1].

Stephenson played a crucial role in influencing American public opinion to support Britain's entry into [[World War II]]. He orchestrated an elaborate black propaganda campaign involving astrologer [[Louis de Wohl]]. Stephenson's agency would feed information to de Wohl for his column, "Stars Foretell," and then disseminate this information to the U.S. press, which, unable to fact-check with [[Nazi Germany]], would report it as real[^1].

Stephenson's efforts were highly effective, with one declassified memo noting that "An ever-growing audience [is] becoming convinced of his supernatural powers"[^1]. He coordinated with [[William Donovan]], who would later head the [[Office of Strategic Services]], the precursor to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]][^1].
