Pinhas Sapir was an Israeli politician who, along with [[Levi Eshkol]], dominated the Israeli budget process for more than fifteen years. He was a perennial critic of [[Israel]]'s nuclear program, viewing the Egyptian arms buildup as the most compelling argument against investing money at [[Dimona]]. Sapir saw a nuclear-armed [[Israel]] as financial madness and believed it would only lead to conflicts with the [[United States]] and a lessened flow of American contributions.[^1]
