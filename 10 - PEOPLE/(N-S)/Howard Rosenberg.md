Howard Rosenberg was a staff member for *60 Minutes*, a prominent American television newsmagazine. He interviewed [[David Morehouse]] at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] in Washington, D.C., in June 1994[^1].

Morehouse, a former member of the [[Remote Viewing]] unit, was preparing to do an interview with *60 Minutes* in which he would claim that the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]'s remote-viewing program at [[Fort Meade]] had made him crazy. Rosenberg's interview was part of the newsmagazine's investigation into the program[^1].

However, *60 Minutes* ultimately decided not to air the show because the [[STARGATE PROJECT|DIA]] remote-viewing program was still classified, and Rosenberg could not find other sources to corroborate that the program even existed. Rosenberg later recalled that "No one would talk about it on the record... and the principal promoter of the story [David Morehouse], and of the program, was of questionable credibility and seemed to me to have multiple agendas"[^1].
