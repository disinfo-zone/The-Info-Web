Peter Squire is a program officer in the [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR)'s Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and Combating Terrorism department. In 2014, ONR embarked on a four-year, $3.85 million research program to explore the phenomena it calls [[Premonition]] and [[Intuition]], or "Spidey sense," for sailors and Marines[^1].

Squire stated, "We have to understand what gives rise to this so-called â€˜sixth sense,'" emphasizing that Navy scientists place less emphasis on trying to understand the phenomena theoretically and more on using technology to examine the mysterious process. The [[Pentagon]]'s focus is to maximize the power of the sixth sense for operational use[^1].
