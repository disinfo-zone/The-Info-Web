[[Thomas Olmstead]] was the attorney for [[Michael Riconosciuto]]. He represented Riconosciuto during his trial in Tacoma, Washington, where Riconosciuto's defense rested on his ability to prove he worked for the [[United States Government|U.S. government]] in intelligence and undercover operations.[^1]

Olmstead questioned [[Peter Videnieks]] during the trial about his knowledge of the [[Wackenhut Corporation]]-[[Cabazon Indian Reservation]] joint venture, his relationship with [[Earl Brian]], and his involvement with Hadron Company. He also pressed Videnieks on "Modification No. 12" of the [[PROMIS]] software and the bankruptcy court's ruling that the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] had "stolen" [[PROMIS]] from [[INSLAW]] through Videnieks' handling of it.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] communicated with [[Cheri Seymour]] and [[J.H.]] (an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent) to convey information that Olmstead could use in his defense, including details about "[[The Company]]" and Riconosciuto's attempts to enter the Witness Protection Program.[^1]
