Chapman Pincher was a British journalist known for his close ties to the British intelligence and nuclear communities. In December 1960, he published a major story in the *London Daily Express* stating that "British and American intelligence authorities believe that the Israelis are well on the way to building their first experimental nuclear bomb." Pincher had received a tip from a senior figure in British atomic weapons research and verified the story with a contact in [[Mossad]].[^1]
