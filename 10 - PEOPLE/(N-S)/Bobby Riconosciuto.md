[[Bobby Riconosciuto]] is the wife of [[Michael Riconosciuto]]. She lived with him at the time of his arrest in Washington State. Immediately after his arrest, she fled to California with their four children, including their youngest daughter, Elizabeth, fathered by Michael.[^1]

Patrick Moriarty, [[Marshall Riconosciuto]]'s business partner, paid for Bobby's stay in an exclusive suite at the Embassy Suites Hotel in Orange County, California. While there, she had access to office equipment and other amenities. Bobby was instrumental in retrieving [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s sensitive files and computer equipment from his hidden trailer in Trona, California, near Death Valley. She was instructed by Michael to keep away from the trailer in case she was being surveilled, as these files were considered Michael's "last ace in the hole."[^1]

Frustrated by the slow progress of Michael's court defense and the lack of response to his requests for Witness Protection, Bobby decided to turn the documents over to [[Cheri Seymour]] for copying. She later intended to store the original documents at [[Marshall Riconosciuto]]'s business in Southern California, and Michael Riconosciuto later claimed Marshall shipped them to [[Ian Stuart Spiro]] for safekeeping.[^1]

In January 1992, Bobby Riconosciuto disclosed that she had been present when [[Robert Booth Nichols]] met with [[Michael Abbell]] in Washington D.C. to discuss "crow-barring" the extradition of [[Cali Drug Cartel]] leaders [[Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela|Gilberto Rodriguez]], [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Jose Londono]], and [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Miguel Rodriguez]], whom they considered "intelligence people."[^1]
