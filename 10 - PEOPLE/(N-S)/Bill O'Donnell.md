[[Bill O'Donnell]] was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer. In May 1973, he inadvertently provided the coordinates for a secret [[NSA]] facility near Sugar Grove, West Virginia, to [[Richard Kennett]]. Kennett had asked O'Donnell for coordinates of a place on the East Coast that, if a drawing or photograph were shown later, O'Donnell would be able to confirm. O'Donnell, unaware of the true purpose, provided the precise coordinates of his summer cabin, which happened to be near the highly classified NSA site.[^1]

This incident, where [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Pat Price]] accurately described the NSA facility despite being given coordinates for O'Donnell's cabin, became known as the Sugar Grove incident. It led to a hostile security investigation, as the psychics' remote viewing data was accurate enough to suggest a massive leakage of top-secret information. O'Donnell initially dismissed the psychics' descriptions as "bullshit" because they didn't match his cabin, but later realized the true implications when Kennett discovered the secret military installation nearby.[^1]
