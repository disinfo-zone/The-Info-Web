Donald T. Regan (1918â€“2003) was an American government official who served as the [[White House]] Chief of Staff under President [[Ronald Reagan]]. In May 1988, Regan revealed in his memoir that President Reagan had sought the advice of a private astrologer during his tenure at the White House[^1].

Regan stated that "Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made during my time as White House chief of staff was cleared by a woman in San Francisco who drew up horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in favorable alignment for the enterprise." This revelation was confirmed by White House press secretary [[Marlin Fitzwater]], who stated that President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, were both deeply interested in astrology[^1].

The astrologer in question was [[Joan Quigley]]. Regan's disclosure brought the association of divination with national security into the news, sparking public interest and debate[^1].
