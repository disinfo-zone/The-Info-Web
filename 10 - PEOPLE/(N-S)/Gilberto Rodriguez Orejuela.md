[[Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela]] was a prominent leader of the [[Cali Drug Cartel]], a powerful Colombian drug trafficking organization that, by 1994, was estimated to control 80% of the world's cocaine trade. He was often referred to simply as "Gilberto" in the context of investigations into the cartel's activities.[1]

Rodriguez Orejuela's influence extended beyond drug trafficking into financial and political spheres. He reportedly owned the Northside Bank of Miami, which was used to launder the cartel's substantial profits. His political reach was highlighted by allegations that [[Ernesto Samper Pizano]], the newly elected president of [[Colombia]], accepted $3.7 million in campaign funds from Rodriguez, effectively aligning the president with the drug lords.[1]

He was a significant target of a major [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] Centac investigation, which led to his indictment in Los Angeles and New York in 1978. However, these cases reportedly did not progress beyond the indictment phase, and the Centac 21 task force was dismantled during the [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George Bush]] administrations. This lack of sustained prosecution led to suspicions among disgruntled [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents of a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] connection.[1]

Rodriguez Orejuela's name was also linked to a "cocaine summit conference" in Panama City in the early 1980s, where he appeared as a delegation leader. Despite his prominent role, his name was later removed from [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] reports under the Reagan administration.[1]

His activities became a critical focus of investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]]'s "[[The Octopus]]" probe. Casolaro had uncovered a connection between Rodriguez Orejuela, [[Michael Abbell]] (a former [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] official), and [[Robert Booth Nichols]] (an international intelligence operative) shortly before his death. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that Nichols paid Abbell to "crowbar" the extradition of Rodriguez Orejuela and [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Jose Londono]], as they were considered "intelligence people."[1]

Rodriguez Orejuela was prosecuted and served a prison term following an indictment unsealed in Miami on June 6, 1995, for laundering money for the Cali Cartel. Surveillance reports indicated his frequent visits to his home in Bogota, Colombia.[1]
