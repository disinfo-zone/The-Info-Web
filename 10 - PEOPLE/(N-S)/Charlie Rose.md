Charlie Rose was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina and a Democrat who chaired the House Intelligence Committee's Evaluation Subcommittee. He became a staunch supporter of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program after being briefed on it in the late 1970s by General [[Edmund Thompson]] and [[Jack Vorona]], the head of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]'s Scientific and Technical Intelligence Directorate.[^1]

Rose toured the remote viewing facilities at both [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) and [[Fort Meade]], chatting with remote viewers and witnessing practice sessions. He even discussed the program with President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Despite the fact that his constituents were in the Bible Belt, where dabbling in the paranormal was often viewed with suspicion, Rose publicly advocated for the program, believing it to be a "hell of a cheap radar system."[^1]

In a revealing interview for *Omni* magazine in 1979, Rose condemned skeptics and "publicity-shy" intelligence officials, making a strong pitch for the program and citing remote viewing data he had seen on an unnamed Soviet target, stating, "What these people 'saw,' was confirmed by aerial photography. There's no way it could have been faked."[^1]
