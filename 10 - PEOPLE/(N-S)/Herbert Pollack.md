Herbert Pollack was a medical consultant for the [[State Department]]. He advocated on behalf of the victims of the [[Moscow Signal]] in a Senate subcommittee investigation. The Moscow Signal was a microwave beam aimed at the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] by the [[Soviet Union]], which was believed to have caused adverse health effects in embassy personnel[^1].

Pollack stated that every lawsuit filed by U.S. embassy employees against the government for exposure to the Moscow Signal was eventually withdrawn, "without a penny being paid." This occurred despite concerns raised by some scientists, like [[Robert O. Becker]] and [[Allan H. Frey]], about the potential lethality of the microwave signals[^1].
