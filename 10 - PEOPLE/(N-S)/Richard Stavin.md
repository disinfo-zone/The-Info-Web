[[Richard Stavin]] was a member of the Organized Crime Strike Force. He supervised the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretaps on [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. Along with [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[Marvin Rudnick]] and [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Thomas Gates]], Stavin believed that [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] had been penetrated by organized crime, based on the wiretaps.[1]

Stavin quit his job after the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] sealed the wiretaps and no prosecutions were pursued in the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] organized crime investigation. The [[Los Angeles Organized Crime Strike Force]] was disbanded following these events.[1]
