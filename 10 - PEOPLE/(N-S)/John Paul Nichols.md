[[John Paul Nichols]] was the son of [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]]. He took over his father's position as acting administrator of the [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians|Cabazon tribe]] when [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] was incarcerated. In 1989, [[Mark Nichols]] inherited the position of administrator from John Paul Nichols.[^1]

John Paul Nichols was the "Project Manager" for the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation|Cabazon]]/[[Wackenhut Corporation]] Joint Venture, also known as Cabazon Arms. On April 4, 1983, he wrote a letter to the Army Discharge Review Board asking for [[Jimmy Hughes]]' military record, as Hughes required security clearances to work in the Joint Venture. He stated that Hughes had been instrumental in developing their reservation security force and providing training, and was becoming involved in matters requiring security clearances for government contracts.[^1]

John Paul Nichols was also involved in the [[Cabazon Casino]] and [[Indio Bingo Palace]]. He made a $30,000 withdrawal from the Bingo Palace's account by check payable to cash. He also wrote a letter to [[Wayne Reeder]] and his attorney, reminding Reeder of an agreement to "get rid" of [[Jimmy Hughes]] so Hughes couldn't expose [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]]' illegal activities.[^1]

[[Tommy Marson]], a known [[Gambino Crime Family]] associate, reportedly lent [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] $50,000 to start the Cabazon Casino, according to John Paul Nichols.[^1]
