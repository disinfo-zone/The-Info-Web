Elad Peled was an Israeli Major General and director of [[Israel]]'s Defense College. In February 1968, [[Henry A. Kissinger]] met privately with a group of Israeli scholars at Peled's [[Jerusalem]] home, where Kissinger had taught the year before. Kissinger's message was that the [[United States]] would not "lift a finger for [[Israel]]" if the Soviets chose to directly intervene.[^1]
