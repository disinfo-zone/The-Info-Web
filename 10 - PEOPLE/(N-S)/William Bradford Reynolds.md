[[William Bradford Reynolds]] served as the Assistant [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in the Civil Rights Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. 

In a document dated May 16, 1985, which Reynolds signed, [[William F. Weld]], [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] in Boston, Massachusetts, was advised that the [[PROMIS]] software was being provided to an Arab Sheik for resale and general distribution.[^1]

[[Bill Hamilton]], owner of [[INSLAW]], received this document in November 2004 from a reliable U.S. intelligence source. [[Donald Carr]] showed the document to Reynolds in 2005, and Reynolds authenticated it. Reynolds stated that [[Lowell Jensen]]'s secretary brought the letter to him for signature because Jensen was unavailable, and the letter needed to be sent that day and signed by someone in [[Edwin Meese]]'s inner circle. He recalled signing the letter but not drafting it. Reynolds also had a vague recollection that [[Edwin Meese]] recused himself on [[PROMIS]] when he became [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] in February 1985, leading Jensen to handle [[PROMIS]]. Reynolds independently remembered [[Richard Armitage]], [[Adnan Khashoggi]], and [[Manucher Ghorbanifar]] working together on [[PROMIS]].[^1]
