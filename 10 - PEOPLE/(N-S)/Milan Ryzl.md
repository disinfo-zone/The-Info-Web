Milan Ryzl was a [[Czech]] parapsychologist active in psi research in the mid-1960s. He conducted an experiment that seemed to confirm [[I. M. Kogan]]'s communications-oriented approach to psi phenomena.[^1]

Ryzl's experiment involved a psychic, Pavel Stepanek, repeatedly guessing bits in a randomly generated 50-bit target sequence. By using a majority-vote error-correcting protocol, similar to techniques used in telecommunications, Ryzl was able to confidently determine that Stepanek had correctly identified the entire sequence after several days and twenty thousand guesses. While the effective bit rate was very low (one word per day), it was considered an impressive proof-of-concept experiment, suggesting the potential for telepathic communication.[^1]
