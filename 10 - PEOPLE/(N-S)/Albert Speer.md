Albert Speer (1905â€“1981) was a German architect who served as the Reich's Minister of Armaments and War Production for [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]]. He was a close confidant of [[Adolf Hitler]][^1].

While serving a life sentence in Spandau prison, Speer recounted [[Rudolf Hess]]'s motivation for his rogue flight to Scotland in May 1941. Speer wrote in *Inside the Third Reich* that "Hess assured me in all seriousness that the idea had been inspired in him in a dream by supernatural forces"[^1].

Speer also noted [[Adolf Hitler]]'s reaction to [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s interest in the occult, quoting Hitler as saying, "What nonsense! Here we have at last reached an age that has left all mysticism behind it, and now he [Himmler] wants to start that all over again. We might just as well have stayed with the church"[^1].
