[[George Otis]] (April 20, 1917 – July 22, 2007) was a former Lear executive and a member of [[Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International|FGBMFI]]. He was a significant figure in Christian broadcasting and evangelism, particularly in the Middle East, and had notable connections within political circles.[^1][^2]

In 1970, Otis, along with [[Pat Boone]], [[Shirley Boone]], and [[Harold Bredesen]], prayed with then-California Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] at his home in Sacramento. Otis was reportedly "overcome with the Spirit" and began to speak in the voice of God, comparing Reagan to a king and prophesying that Reagan would "reside at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue" if he continued to walk in God's way. Reagan reportedly took the prophecy very seriously. A Reagan Aide who later worked on [[Pat Robertson]]'s presidential campaign invited [[Nita Scoggan]], the wife of an FGBMFI member, to form a prayer group in the [[White House]]. [[Oliver North]] reportedly attended these prayer meetings.[^1][^2]

Otis founded [[High Adventure Ministries]], a Christian organization known for operating what was probably the first radio station in the Middle East (first located in [[Lebanon]] then moving to [[Israel]] after being attacked by terrorists) to preach the Gospel and play country music. The station was established in 1979 on a battlefield in southern [[Lebanon]] under the "Voice of Hope" banner. This evangelical radio ministry later expanded globally via shortwave radio. Otis also founded [[Middle East Television]] (METV), which was later passed on to CBN. In 2000, METV relocated to [[Cyprus]]. High Adventure also ran a program called [[Lebanon Aid]].[^2]

Otis authored or co-authored a dozen books, including his autobiography, "High Adventure," and "The Guns of God," a manual on spiritual warfare.[^2]

Otis was born in Payne, Ohio, and was an adventure-seeker from a young age. He took business classes at Earlham College and founded several electronics-related companies and later was general chairman of [[LearJet]]. 

Otis was deeply involved in the Charismatic revival in the [[United States]], and he and [[Harold Bredesen]] were considered "Holy Spirit fathers" by [[Pat Boone]].[^2]
