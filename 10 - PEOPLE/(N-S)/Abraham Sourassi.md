Abraham Sourassi was a senior Israeli engineer at [[Dimona]], responsible for building the reprocessing plant. He endeared himself to his countrymen by declaring, "Good riddance," upon hearing of [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s disenchantment with [[Dimona]], reflecting the typical Israeli attitude of self-reliance.[^1]
