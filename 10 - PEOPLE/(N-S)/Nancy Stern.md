[[Nancy Stern]] was an Army civilian photo-interpreter and one of the original members of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Gondola Wish]] (later [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]]) remote viewing unit. She was among the initial group of ten or eleven candidates selected by [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] and [[Murray Watt|Scotty Watt]] for the experimental program, with a heavy emphasis on photo-interpreters due to their visual skills.[^1]

Stern was present during the intense and monotonous remote viewing taskings related to the Iran hostage crisis (1979-1981). After the failed hostage rescue mission in April 1980, she became emotionally distraught, crying and expressing anger at the debacle, and subsequently left the unit. Her departure, along with that of [[Fern Gauvin]], highlighted the psychological toll of the relentless remote viewing operations.[^1]
