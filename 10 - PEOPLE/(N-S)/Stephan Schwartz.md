# Stephan Schwartz

Stephan Schwartz is a former naval officer and researcher who became deeply involved in [[Parapsychology|psychic research]], particularly in the area of [[Remote Viewing]]. He served as a special assistant for research and analysis to Chief of Naval Operations Admiral [[Elmo Zumwalt]], where he was briefed on the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[Telepathy|telepathy]] studies and Soviet efforts in the field[^1].

Schwartz was aware of a notable Soviet [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] experiment from around 1956, which allegedly involved a mother rabbit, her newborn litter, a submerged Soviet submarine, and a research station on shore. In this experiment, the baby rabbits were placed aboard the submarine, and electrodes were implanted in the mother rabbit's brain on shore. When the baby rabbits were killed one by one, the mother rabbit's brain produced detectable and recordable reactions, suggesting that [[Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Waves|ELF]] might be an ESP information carrier channel[^1].

In 1975, Schwartz left the Navy to pursue his enthusiasm for psychic research, accepting a fellowship with the Philosophical Research Society in Los Angeles. He had an idea to put a distant viewer (a psychic) aboard one of the Navy's submarines during sea trials to test [[Remote Viewing]] capabilities, but Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]] declined due to concerns about media attention[^1].

However, in the summer of 1977, Schwartz found an opportunity to conduct such an experiment. He teamed up with deep-sea explorers [[Don Keach]] and [[Don Walsh]], who had access to the *Taurus I*, a state-of-the-art, five-man submersible. Schwartz, along with [[Hal Puthoff]], [[Dale Graff]], the [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] team, and psychics [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Hella Hammid]], conducted [[Project Deep Quest]], one of the most unique psychic functioning experiments of the 1970s[^1].

For the unclassified part of the project, Schwartz aimed to locate a previously unknown shipwreck on the seafloor. He provided Swann and Hammid with a nautical chart of Catalina Island and asked them to locate any sea wreck using [[Map Dowsing]]. Both psychics independently marked a single target on the composite map, which was later confirmed to be a previously unidentified shipwreck by the claw on *Taurus I*[^1].

For the classified [[U.S. Air Force]] project, Schwartz, Puthoff, and Graff designed a remote-viewing experiment where psychics in the submerged *Taurus I* would attempt to identify images from sealed envelopes, with Puthoff and Graff acting as beacons at the target sites. This experiment aimed to test long-distance remote viewing inside a submersible and served as a fail-safe protocol for emergency military scenarios[^1].
