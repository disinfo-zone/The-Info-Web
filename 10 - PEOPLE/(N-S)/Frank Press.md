Frank Press was the presidential science adviser during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration. He was a seismologist who had worked for years on classified nuclear detection issues and knew the [[VELA Satellite]] program well. After a VELA satellite recorded probable evidence of a nuclear explosion on September 22, 1979, Press suggested convening an unbiased outside study to determine if it was a test. He was concerned about the political implications if it leaked that the administration had concluded there had been a nuclear explosion.[^1]
