# Yoav Shacham

Yoav Shacham was an [[Israel|Israeli]] grain trader and alleged spy who significantly influenced [[Uri Geller]]'s early life and aspirations. Shacham was a resident at the hotel in Nicosia, [[Cyprus]], run by Geller's stepfather, Ladislas Gero[^1].

Shacham, described as tough-looking and powerfully built, practiced martial arts in the hotel garden, which intrigued a fourteen-year-old Geller. Geller, seeking to impress Shacham, demonstrated his ability to bend metal spoons and keys. Shacham, impressed, offered to teach Geller martial arts[^1].

Geller confided in Shacham, claiming he could read his mind and knew he was an Israeli spy. Shacham, whose cover was compromised, presented Geller with a challenge: to join the Israeli Army as a paratrooper, work hard, become the best soldier, attend officer training school, and then find him. Shacham promised that only then would he get Geller into the [[Mossad]] (Israel's intelligence agency). This undertaking gave Geller a sense of purpose[^1].

Geller diligently followed Shacham's instructions, joining the Israeli army in 1965 and entering officer training school. However, his dream was shattered in November 1966 when a national newspaper reported that Major Yoav Shacham had been killed in action during a skirmish in a Jordanian border town[^1]. Geller's opportunity to do secret government work for Mossad seemingly died with his friend, though he would later have connections to Israeli intelligence[^1].
