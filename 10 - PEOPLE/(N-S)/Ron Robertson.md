Ron Robertson was a security officer for the [[Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC). He was assigned to oversee national security issues between the AEC, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]], and the [[CIA]] during [[Uri Geller]]'s classified [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]] tests in the winter of 1975[^1].

These tests, conducted at a laboratory adjacent to Livermore in an old wooden [[World War II]] barracks, involved firing high-quality lasers at a target and placing magnetic computer program cards in a lead container to see if Geller could interfere with them. Robertson's role was to ensure security protocols were maintained, especially given Geller's status as a foreign national and unresolved potential role with the [[Mossad]][^1].

After the second day of tests, Robertson called [[Kit Green]] at [[CIA]] headquarters, reporting that several nuclear weapons engineers had seen inexplicable phenomena, including "items flying across the room. Lights flashing. A six-inch ball of light, rolling down the hallway. One scientist reported seeing a flying orb." These incidents, which Green privately thought sounded like "poltergeist events," caused concern at both the AEC and the [[CIA]], leading Green to investigate whether the scientists were experiencing hallucinations[^1].
