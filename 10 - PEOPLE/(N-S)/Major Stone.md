Major Stone was an aide to Major General [[Edmund Thompson]], the [[U.S. Army]] Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence (ACSI). He played a role in the early days of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]] by serving as an "outbound experimenter" or "beacon" for remote viewing sessions.[^1]

In one notable instance, Stone was the target for [[Edmund Thompson]]'s own remote viewing attempt. Although Thompson initially misidentified Stone's location, he later realized he had accurately perceived a nearby Masonic Temple, which was more prominent than Stone's actual location at the Alexandria train station. Stone also brought taskings from the Pentagon to the remote viewing unit, including the urgent request to find a lost [[U.S. Navy]] A-6 attack aircraft.[^1]
