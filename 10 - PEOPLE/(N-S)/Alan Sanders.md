[[Alan Sanders]] was a businessman with links to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. His cover was [[ITICO]] (Integrated Technologies International Co.). He was involved in supplying technology for cluster bombs to [[Carlos Cardoen]], specifically in the form of blueprints. This was done with a covert [[USA|U.S.]] license, despite a [[United Nations]] arms embargo against [[Chile]].[^1]

In late 1985, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] approached Sanders to purchase cluster bombs for [[Israel]]. Sanders made it clear that the sale of cluster bombs to [[Israel]] was prohibited by the [[USA|U.S.]]. However, he introduced Ben-Menashe to [[Richard Babayan]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contract agent with close contacts with [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen]], indicating that Cardoen would sell the bombs to [[Israel]].[^1]
