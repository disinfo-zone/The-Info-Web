Swaleh Naqvi was the chief operating officer of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], taking over after [[Agha Hasan Abedi]]'s 1988 heart attack.[^1]

### Role at BCCI

Naqvi was instrumental in the day-to-day operations and manipulations within BCCI. He personally maintained some six thousand secret accounts, which were at the core of the bank's deception.[^2] He was responsible for orchestrating the sale of [[Clark Clifford]] and [[Robert Altman]]'s stock in [[First American Bank]] to a BCCI front man.[^3]

Naqvi, along with Abedi, was indicted by [[Robert Morgenthau]], the Manhattan district attorney, in July 1991 for fraud, bribery, grand larceny, and money laundering.[^4] He was also indicted by the [[Justice Department]] in November 1991 for his role in the bond manipulation at [[CenTrust Savings Bank]] and the secret ownership of [[Independence Bank of Encino]].[^5]

### Connections and Influence

Naqvi had close ties with Abedi and was involved in many of the bank's illicit activities, including the use of nominees and offshore networks to conceal ownership and financial transactions.[^6] He was also involved in the meeting where [[Eugene Holley]] introduced [[Bert Lance]] to Abedi.[^7]
