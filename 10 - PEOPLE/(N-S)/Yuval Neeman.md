Yuval Neeman was an Israeli physicist and defense ministry intelligence officer. He was directly involved in [[Israel]]'s nuclear weapons program. Neeman was responsible for drafting [[David Ben-Gurion]]'s responses to [[John F. Kennedy]]'s increasingly sour correspondence regarding [[Dimona]]. Neeman described the exchange as "not a friendly exchange" and that Kennedy was "writing like a bully. It was brutal."[^1]
