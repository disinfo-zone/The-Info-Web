Garrison Rapmund was a Major General and the Assistant Surgeon General of the [[U.S. Army]]. In July 1984, after [[Albert Stubblebine]] was forced into early retirement and the [[Remote Viewing]] program was up for grabs, Rapmund engaged in discussions to move the program under his command within the [[Army Medical Research and Development Command]] at [[Fort Detrick]], Maryland[^1].

His intention was to emphasize testing the physiology of the viewers. However, after several rounds of negotiations, the Office of the Surgeon General ultimately declined to take over the program[^1].
