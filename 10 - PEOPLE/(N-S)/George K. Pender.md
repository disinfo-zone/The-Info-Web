[[George K. Pender]] was a Director of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] and a former Director of the Pacific Ocean area for Burns & Roe, Inc., an international engineering and construction corporation. He also served as a Senior Engineer Consultant to Burns & Roe, Inc.[^1]

Pender played a significant role in [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]]'s activities in [[Lebanon]]. A letter dated July 12, 1983, from Pender to [[Amin Gamayel]], the president of [[Lebanon]], indicated [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]]'s interest in arranging financing for the redevelopment of [[Lebanon]], specifically mentioning the rebuilding of Damour and Alkhyam. This letter also noted that Pender had previously visited Beirut in February and May 1983 to discuss [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]]'s participation, with meetings held with the Chamouns, [[Maurice Ghanem]], and Mourad Baroudy.[^1]

Pender's letter to President Gamayel also notably listed [[Robert Booth Nichols]]' telex number (652483 RBN ASSOCS LSA) for responses, indicating a close operational link between Pender and Nichols. The Arab Bank Limited in Amman, [[Jordan]], responded positively to a potential financial transaction of "US$ three billion or more" for the reconstruction of [[Lebanon]], though the text suggests it is unlikely such reconstruction fully materialized.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed to have worked directly under [[Maurice Ghanem]] and [[George K. Pender]] in [[Lebanon]], further linking Pender to the alleged drug/intelligence operations in the region. Riconosciuto also stated that [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] had a companion company called Euramae Trading, which operated throughout the Middle East and was involved in the drug trade, allegedly as a [[National Security Council|NSC]]-directed operation.[^1]
