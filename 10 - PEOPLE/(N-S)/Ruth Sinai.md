Ruth Sinai was a Washington correspondent for the Associated Press. In November 1991, she broke the story about [[PSI Tech]], a private firm run by retired military intelligence officers, being enlisted by the [[United Nations]] to find [[Saddam Hussein]]'s weapon sites. Her article, titled "U.N. Enlists Psychic Firm to Find Iraqiâ€™s Weapon Sites," marked the beginning of the end for the U.S. government's twenty-three-year history in [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]] research[^1].

Sinai's report focused on the work of [[Karen Jansen]], a UN inspector and Army major, who allegedly carried sketches of Iraqi biological weapons sites provided by PSI Tech president [[Ed Dames]]. Dames told Sinai that he and his associates drew the sketches through [[Remote Viewing]], which he described as a learned technique that doesn't require psychic powers but rather suppressing imagination and concentrating on a target[^1].
