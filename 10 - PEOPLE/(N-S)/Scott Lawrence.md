[[Scott Lawrence]] is a [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]] internal affairs investigator from Boston. He became involved in the investigation of the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]], initially focusing on [[Peter Videnieks]], a [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]] contract specialist detailed to the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] in the early 1980s for the development of the [[PROMIS]] software.[1]

Lawrence's investigation quickly expanded beyond the software to follow a drug trail. His deep-cover drug investigation was code-named [[THE INDO-CHINA PROJECT]], operating on the Maine/Canadian border. However, his probe was abruptly shut down after he and his supervisor, [[John (Tim) Kelly]], requested to impanel grand juries in several states to depose officials from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] declined this request, and [[Peter Videnieks]] was never charged with any wrongdoing.[1]

Despite the obstruction, Lawrence is noted as one of only two investigators who remained in law enforcement after directly or peripherally investigating the alleged theft of the [[PROMIS]] software and its connections to high-level organized crime, drugs, and money laundering.[1]
