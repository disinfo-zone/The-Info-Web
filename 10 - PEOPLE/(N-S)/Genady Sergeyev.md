# Genady Sergeyev

Genady Sergeyev was a Soviet military doctor who oversaw experiments with the renowned psychic [[Ninel Kulagina]]. He is prominently featured in a classified film from March 10, 1970, at the Ukhtomskii Military Institute in Leningrad, which depicted Kulagina allegedly stopping a frog's heart with her mind[^1].

During the experiment, Sergeyev monitored Kulagina's physiological responses, which included a heart rate of 240 and elevated blood pressure, as she concentrated on stopping the frog's heart. According to declassified documents, the heart activity ceased after approximately 7 minutes in the first experiment and 22 minutes in a second. She was also reportedly able to "reactivate" the heart[^1].

Sergeyev also oversaw an experiment where Kulagina attempted to increase the heart rate of a skeptical physician, which reportedly reached dangerous levels. While some U.S. analysts suspected these demonstrations were part of a Soviet disinformation campaign, others in the U.S. military, particularly the Medical Intelligence Office of the [[U.S. Army]], considered the potential military applications of such abilities to be highly significant[^1].
