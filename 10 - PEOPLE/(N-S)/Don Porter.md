Don Porter was an official with [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command|INSCOM]] at Arlington Hall. He tasked the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] remote viewers with precognitive missions, seeking to gain intelligence on future events.[^1]

In one notable instance, Porter asked [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] to have his remote viewers predict the outcome of secret talks between military and civilian officials from North and South Korea, to be held in a farmhouse in the demilitarized zone. Porter wanted to know the North Korean delegates' negotiating strategies and how far they could be pushed.[^1]

Despite [[Joe McMoneagle]]'s theory that the random responses from the remote viewers indicated something was wrong with the target, and that the meeting might not occur, Porter proceeded with his scheduled flight to Korea. Shortly after his arrival, he was informed that the North Koreans had indeed canceled the meeting, confirming the remote viewers' collective, albeit indirect, precognition.[^1]
