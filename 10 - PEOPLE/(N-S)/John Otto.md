John Otto was the former Acting Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He was mentioned in the context of the [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] due to [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s allegations regarding the FBI's Field Office Information Management System ([[FOIMS]]).

Inslaw claimed that an unnamed "senior career Justice Department official" told Inslaw that John Otto had admitted to him that FOIMS was actually [[PROMIS]]. However, Otto denied making such a statement, telling investigators that he was "computer illiterate" and had insufficient technical knowledge to discuss such a subject. The Special Counsel's investigation found no credible evidence to support Inslaw's allegation, concluding that FOIMS was not PROMIS or any derivative of PROMIS and was developed independently by the FBI. The unnamed source who allegedly heard Otto make the admission never came forward despite repeated requests from the Special Counsel's office.[^1]
