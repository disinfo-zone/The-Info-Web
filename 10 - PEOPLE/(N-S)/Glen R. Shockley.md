[[Glen R. Shockley]] was a Director of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] and a consultant to Fortune 500 Companies in business management, internationally known as a financial consultant in funding. He was also a corporate partner in [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]], a holding company headed by [[Robert Booth Nichols]].[^1]

Shockley's name appeared in [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s statement to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], where Riconosciuto claimed that [[Robert Booth Nichols]] "runs [[Glen R. Shockley]]. [[Glen R. Shockley]] runs [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Jose Londono]]" and that Nichols, [[Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela|Gilbert Rodriguez]], and [[Michael Abbell]] were "all in bed together." Riconosciuto further alleged that Nichols handed Abbell $50,000 cash to handle an internal affairs investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] that would have led to the extradition of [[Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela|Gilbert]] and [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Miguel Rodriguez]] and [[Jose Santacruz Londono|Jose Londono]], because they were "intelligence people."[^1]

His involvement with [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] and [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]] places him within the complex network investigated by [[Danny Casolaro]] as "[[The Octopus]]."[^1]
