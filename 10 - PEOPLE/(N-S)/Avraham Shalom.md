Avraham Shalom was the director of [[Shin Bet]], [[Israel]]'s internal security agency. He was forced to resign his post in late June 1984 due to cover-up charges in connection with the Shin Bet killing in 1984 of two Palestinian hijackers while in custody. Shalom was part of a six-man Israeli delegation that arrived in [[Washington D.C.]] in August 1986 to resolve the [[Jonathan Pollard]] affair. He, along with [[Ram Caspi]] and [[Hanan Bar-on]], had been appointed by [[Shimon Peres]] immediately after Pollard's arrest to conduct an internal investigation. They reported within a week that Pollard was part of a rogue intelligence-gathering unit that operated without any government awareness.[^1]

[[Rafael Eitan]] had a need to settle old scores with [[Yitzhak Hofi]], the head of [[Mossad]], and [[Avraham Shalom]], Shin Beth's director. This personal ambition and need for revenge drove Eitan's actions, including the recruitment of [[Jonathan Pollard]].[^1]
