[[John St. John]] was a Detective with the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]'s Organized Crime Intelligence Division ([[OCID]]). He was implicated in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretap investigation into alleged organized crime penetration of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]].[^1]

[[Martin Bacow]] boasted to [[Eugene Giaquinto]] that St. John's status within OCID allowed him to obtain intelligence reports on organized crime figures across the nation, which Bacow could then pass along to Giaquinto. St. John was allegedly Bacow's direct contact at LAPD-OCID.[^1]

During the process of opening a grand jury investigation into the mob's involvement in the motion picture industry, St. John called Bacow and told him he would listen, not give up too much, and try to find out what the investigators were looking at to inform Bacow. Bacow then called Giaquinto, who responded that he would call [[Edwin Meese]] and get the investigation shut down.[^1]

Despite the wiretap information and related investigation reportedly gathering enough evidence to justify seeking an indictment against St. John, Giaquinto, and Bacow for obstruction of justice, no indictment was ever issued. The prosecution reportedly did not go forward because no one at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] in Washington D.C. wanted all the wiretap affidavits in the case to be released.[^1]
