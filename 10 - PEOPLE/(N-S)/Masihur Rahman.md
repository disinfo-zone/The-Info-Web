Masihur Rahman was the former chief financial officer of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^1] He explained the financial legerdemain that resulted in the disappearance of billions of dollars.[^2] Rahman later testified before a Senate subcommittee.[^3]

### Role at BCCI

Rahman was brought into United Bank by [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] and [[Swaleh Naqvi]] in 1966, and moved with them when Abedi created BCCI.[^4] He brought with him the original handwritten ledgers of the bank's first year of operation in [[Abu Dhabi]].[^5]

After BCCI pleaded guilty to money laundering in January 1990, Rahman was placed in charge of an internal audit committee to verify the Price Waterhouse figures.[^6] His findings showed that the bank's books were in a shambles, with hundreds of millions of dollars loaned or transferred without paperwork, and hundreds of millions more simply disappeared.[^7]

Rahman was very nervous about discussing BCCI's affairs with the press due to threats to his family.[^8] He described a secret bank within the bank, International Credit and Investment Company Holdings (ICIC) in the [[Cayman Islands]], into which billions of dollars in deposits were improperly diverted.[^9]
