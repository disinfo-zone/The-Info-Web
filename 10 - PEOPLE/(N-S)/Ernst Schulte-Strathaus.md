# Ernst Schulte-Strathaus

Ernst Schulte-Strathaus was a German astrologer who, alongside [[Karl Krafft]], was reported to have constructed star charts that influenced [[Rudolf Hess]]'s decision to undertake his rogue flight to Scotland in May 1941. Hess, the Deputy Führer of [[Nazi Germany]], reportedly chose this date based on astrological advice, believing it to be cosmically suited for his secret mission[^1].

Like other practitioners of the occult, Schulte-Strathaus would have been affected by "[[Special Action Hess]]" (Sonderaktion Heß), the mass arrest of astrologers and other occultists initiated by [[Adolf Hitler]] following Hess's flight[^1]. This crackdown aimed to suppress belief systems outside the official Nazi ideology, despite some high-ranking officials like [[Heinrich Himmler]] maintaining private interests in such fields[^1].
