[[Marshall Riconosciuto]] was the father of [[Michael Riconosciuto]] and a business partner of [[Patrick Moriarty]] for 40 years. Together, they owned several California businesses, including [[Hercules Research Corporation]] and [[Pyrotronics Corporation]].[^1]

In 1981, Hercules Research Corporation developed a small electronic power supply designed to feed 30,000 volts of electricity to a METC (Modular Energy Transfer Catalyzer) unit, which could significantly reduce heating and cooling times in various industrial processes. Marshall Riconosciuto and [[Patrick Moriarty]] had funded research for 15 years, investing approximately $1 million of their own money into the project.[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that Marshall shipped documents to [[Ian Stuart Spiro]] for safekeeping. At the time [[Bobby Riconosciuto]] intended to store Michael's original documents at Marshall's business in Southern California, Marshall was reportedly very ill.[^1]
