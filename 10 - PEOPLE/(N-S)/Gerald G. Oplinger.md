Gerald G. Oplinger was an aide to [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] for global issues. He had retired from the Foreign Service and worked at the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] before joining Brzezinski's staff. Oplinger was summoned back to an urgent meeting in the White House situation room after a [[VELA Satellite]] recorded two distinctive bright flashes of light over the South Indian Ocean on September 22, 1979, probable evidence of a nuclear explosion. He recalled that [[Zbigniew Brzezinski|Brzezinski]] was present at the meeting, where the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] stated that the odds were at least ninety percent that it had been a nuclear explosion. Oplinger personally had no doubt that it was a nuclear event.[^1]
