Jack P. Ruina was a professor of electrical engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and a longtime consultant to the [[Pentagon]] on military and scientific issues. He was chosen by [[Frank Press]] to direct an outside panel to study the [[VELA Satellite]] data after a probable nuclear explosion was detected on September 22, 1979. Ruina held many sensitive clearances and was known for his discretion.[^1]

His panel's assignment was carefully weighted towards investigating the possibility that the VELA sighting had been a false alarm. The panel concluded that the VELA sighting "contains sufficient internal inconsistency to cast serious doubt whether that signal originated from a nuclear explosion or in fact from any light sources in the proximity of the VELA satellite." They also found no collateral signs of a nuclear event. The panel eventually reported in July 1980 that the flash was "probably not from a nuclear explosion," suggesting it might have been a "zoo event" (a signal of unknown cause), possibly a meteoroid impact.[^1]
