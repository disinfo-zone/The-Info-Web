[[Chuck Schumer]] is a United States Senator from New York and the Senate Majority Leader. He has become a leading champion for [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) transparency, sponsoring the historic UAP Disclosure Act of 2023.[^1]

### Sponsorship of the UAP Disclosure Act

In the summer of 2023, Senator Schumer, along with a bipartisan group of senators including [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Mike Rounds]], sponsored the UAP Disclosure Act. This legislation was designed to force the disclosure of government records related to UAP, technologies of unknown origin, and non-human intelligence. The act proposed the creation of a presidentially-appointed review board to declassify UAP records and give the government the power of eminent domain over any recovered non-human technology held by private entities.[^1]

While the full act was not passed, key provisions were included in the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). These provisions direct the National Archives to collect and disclose UAP-related records and make it illegal for any entity to use taxpayer money for UAP-related matters without congressional approval.[^1]

### Commitment to Transparency

Senator Schumer has been a vocal advocate for the public's right to know about the UAP issue. He has stated that "The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena." He has also expressed his commitment to carrying on the legacy of his mentor, former Senator [[Harry Reid]], in fighting for UAP transparency.[^1]
