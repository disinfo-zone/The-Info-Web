Yehoshua Saguy was the chief of military intelligence in [[Israel]]. He opposed the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak]] in June 1981, arguing that the adverse reaction in [[Washington D.C.]] would be a more serious national security threat to [[Israel]] than the Iraqi reactor itself. He suffered for his dissent, not being informed of the mission until three days before it was scheduled to take place. Saguy responded by briefly threatening to withhold intelligence.[^1]

He joined [[Yitzhak Hofi]], the director of [[Mossad]], and [[Yigael Yadin]], the deputy prime minister, in their futile dissent against the Osirak attack. Saguy took exception to the view that any Israeli military steps to avoid a "second Holocaust" were permissible.[^1]
