Richard G. Stilwell (1917â€“1991) was a retired [[U.S. Army]] four-star general who served as the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. He was a distinguished military figure, having participated in the Normandy Invasion in [[World War II]], served as head of the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Thailand during the [[Vietnam War]], and commanded the United Nations Command in Korea[^1].

In January 1981, Stilwell took an interest in Lieutenant Colonel [[John B. Alexander]]'s controversial article, "The New Mental Battlefield: Beam Me Up, Spock." After an informal meeting with Alexander, Stilwell arranged for his transfer to the [[Intelligence and Security Command|INSCOM]] under Major General [[Albert Stubblebine]]. This move formally brought Alexander into the realm of psychic research within the military[^1].
