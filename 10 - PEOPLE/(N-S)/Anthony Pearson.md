[[Anthony Pearson]] was a former British Special Airborne Service ([[SAS]]) officer who ran a company called [[Strategic Intelligence Services]], located in [[London]]. His firm provided espionage services to [[Israel]], among others.[^1]

[[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] was known for recruiting mercenaries from [[Lafayette]], [[Louisiana]], and sending them to various parts of the world. His men were involved in helping the Muslim government's troops in southern [[Sudan]] fight against Christian-Animist revolutionaries in the early 1970s. In November 1981, some of his men participated in an unsuccessful coup in the [[Seychelles]], where they were arrested for bringing in AK-47s in golf bags.[^1]

According to [[Mossad]] files, [[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] could also arrange assassinations for $50,000, splitting the fee with a hit man recruited in [[Louisiana]].[^1]

[[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] recruited [[Nicholas Davies]], the London *Daily Mirror* foreign editor, for [[Mossad]] in the 1970s. He also worked with [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah]], a former colonel in the [[Jordan|Jordanian]] Army. [[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] used [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi's]] unwitting help to acquire intelligence about Palestinian organizations in [[Europe]] by selling arms to them. This allowed [[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] to pass intelligence to [[Mossad]] about the groups' movements and weapons. Based on [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi's]] tips, 14 or 15 Palestinians were eliminated over a two-month period.[^1]

In 1978, [[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] offered [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] a Â£200,000 loan, making it clear the money came from an [[Israel|Israeli]] source, and recruited him to work for an antiterrorist group in [[Israel]] run by [[Rafi Eitan]].[^1]
