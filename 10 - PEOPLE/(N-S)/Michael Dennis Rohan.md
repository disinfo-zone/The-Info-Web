In 1969, he was a volunteer at [[Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon]] in [[Israel]], where he shared a room with [[Ari Ben-Menashe]].

[[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan]] was responsible for an arson attack on the [[El Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]] in August 1969. He believed that destroying the mosque was necessary for the rebuilding of the Third Temple and the return of Jesus. He was reportedly involved with the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL) in this act. [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] played a role in his apprehension, reporting him to the [[Israel|Israeli]] police.[^1]
