[[Abdul Majeed Shoman]] was the Chairman and General Manager of [[Arab Bank Limited]] in Amman, [[Jordan]]. He wrote a letter to [[George K. Pender]] of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] on November 23, 1983, stating that Arab Bank, along with a group of other banks, would be glad to cooperate concerning a fund to reconstruct [[Lebanon]]. Shoman confirmed that there would be "no problem to take care of" a financial transaction amounting to "US$ three billion or more," provided the condition in [[Lebanon]] was clear and subject to the approval and counter guarantees of the Lebanese Authority.[^1]
