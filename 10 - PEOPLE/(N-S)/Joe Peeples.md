[[Joe Peeples]] was a Texan businessman who, along with [[Yaacov Meridor]] and a Romanian expatriate, devised a scheme to sell a theoretically feasible but practically impossible solar energy system to the [[Hunt brothers]] of [[Texas]] for $2 million. Peeples was unable to return the $2 million to the Hunts and was subsequently jailed for fraud.[^1]
