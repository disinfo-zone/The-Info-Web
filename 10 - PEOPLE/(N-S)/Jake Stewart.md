[[Jake Stewart]] was a Navy lieutenant commander on the [[National Security Council|National Security Council]] staff during the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration. He was an enthusiastic supporter of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program and played a key role in tasking remote viewers with sensitive intelligence problems.[^1]

In September 1979, Stewart brought [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] satellite photographs of a large industrial facility at the port of Severodvinsk in northern [[Soviet Union|Russia]]. He tasked the remote viewers, particularly [[Joe McMoneagle]], to determine what was happening inside Building 402, a massive structure at the facility. McMoneagle's remote viewing sessions accurately described a very large submarine under construction, including its unique features and even the method of its launch. This information, later confirmed by satellite photos, sparked a lively debate within the NSC about the value of remote viewing, with Stewart being a strong believer in its utility as a national asset.[^1]
