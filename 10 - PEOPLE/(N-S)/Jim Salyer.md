Jim Salyer was a deputy to [[Dale Graff]] at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]. He raised significant concerns about the operational structure and effectiveness of the [[Remote Viewing]] unit at [[Fort Meade]], particularly regarding the lack of scientific understanding and experience within the Army group[^1].

In his "Secret Working Papers," Salyer outlined "existing problems" at Fort Meade, stating that "Whereas the [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] group is managed by scientists with extensive experience in understanding and researching [[Psi]] phenomena, the Army group has no one associated with it who has any understanding of psi phenomena or experience in researching or utilizing remote viewing." He criticized the unit as being composed of "amateurs, led by another amateur, and being trained by yet another amateur," which he believed explained the lack of astounding results[^1].

Salyer's damning assessment led to a critical review of the program and eventually resulted in the DIA gaining control of the Fort Meade personnel. He also believed that his concerns about the lack of scientific rigor allowed problems such as [[Ed Dames]]'s anomaly targeting to exist[^1].
