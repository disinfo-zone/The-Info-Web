[[John Newcomer]] was the new head of the Organized Crime Strike Force in Los Angeles. He advised [[Marvin Rudnick]] that Rudnick was under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility for including [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] in his investigation of [[Sal Pisello]].[^1]

[[William Hundley]], retained by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], discussed the Pisello case with Newcomer and inquired about [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s status in the investigation. Newcomer responded to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] that the allegations against Rudnick were a cause of great concern and that steps were being taken to ensure only factually accurate statements appeared in pleadings and oral arguments. He concluded by stating that neither [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] nor its executives or employees were targets of that case and its attendant investigation.[^1]

[[Marvin Rudnick]] believed that Newcomer came into the Strike Force with an agenda to obstruct justice. The first draft of [[Richard Stavin]]'s prosecution memorandum was given to Newcomer, and Stavin's investigation was unofficially shut down around January 1989. No indictment was ever issued against [[John St. John]], [[Eugene Giaquinto]], or [[Martin Bacow]] for obstruction of justice, with the prosecution reportedly not going forward because no one at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] in Washington D.C. wanted all the wiretap affidavits in the case to be released.[^1]
