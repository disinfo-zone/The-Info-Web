[[Art Suchesk]] was a friend of [[Allan Boyak]] from his Green Beret days. He ran a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] proprietary company called [[Hoffman Electronics]]. Suchesk repeatedly encountered [[Robert Booth Nichols]] in places like [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Taiwan]] over a two-year period after the Los Angeles [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] dropped its interest in Nichols. Suchesk was based out of Zurich, [[Switzerland]], during this time, reportedly continuing his "front man work" for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].[^1]
