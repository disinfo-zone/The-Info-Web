[[Joseph F. Preloznik]] was an individual in Madison, Wisconsin, to whom [[Robert Booth Nichols]] wrote a letter on April 13, 1983. This letter outlined proposed arms projects, including the construction of a two-story building of approximately 7500 square feet with concrete walls and floors to house an "R & D position." This facility was referenced in a 1981 [[Wackenhut Corporation|Wackenhut]] Inter-office memorandum as a companion facility to [[Wackenhut Corporation]] to be constructed on the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation]] for the assembly of shell casings, propellants, war heads, fuses, combustible cartridge cases, and other weapons systems.[^1]

Nichols stated to Preloznik, "Should there be any questions with regard to my credibility, verification can be made through [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|F.I.D.C.O.]]. I have enclosed a copy of that appointment."[^1]
