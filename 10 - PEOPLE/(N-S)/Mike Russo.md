Mike Russo was a physicist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL) who, along with other Livermore personnel, experienced a series of bizarre, hallucination-inducing phenomena after their involvement with [[Uri Geller]]. These apparitions included hovering, monochrome flying saucers and strange animals, such as large raven-like birds.[^1]

Russo and others began to seriously question their sanity due to these experiences. He was part of the group that met with [[Richard Kennett]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to discuss the unsettling events. Russo also complained about a telephone call from a strange metallic voice that demanded the Livermore group cease its research activities with Geller, after which the apparitions faded away.[^1]
