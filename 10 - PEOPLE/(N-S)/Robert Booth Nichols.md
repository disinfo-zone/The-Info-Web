[[Robert Booth Nichols]] is a figure frequently mentioned in connection with [[Danny Casolaro]]'s "[[The Octopus]]" investigation, described as an international intelligence operative with extensive ties to government, organized crime, and illicit activities. He was born in 1943 or 1944.[1]

### Key Roles and Affiliations

Nichols held significant positions in several organizations, often described as cutouts for intelligence operations:

*   **[[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]] (First Intercontinental Development Corporation):** Nichols served as a Director, Senior Vice President, and Chairman of the Investment Committee. FIDCO was reportedly a [[National Security Council|NSC]] cutout used in Lebanon, notably involved in arranging the release of a prisoner and discussions about a multi-billion dollar financial transaction for the reconstruction of Lebanon. Other board members included [[Michael A. McManus]], [[George K. Pender]], [[Robert Maheu]], [[Clint W. Murchison, Jr.]], [[Kenneth A. Roe]], [[Frances T. Fox]], [[William M. Pender]], and [[Glen R. Shockley]].[1]
*   **Meridian International Logistics (MIL):** Nichols was a principal in this holding company, which was under [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation as a "source of funding for the purchasing of narcotics/controlled substances and the allocation and use of the proceeds from its trafficking." MIL was also reportedly an [[National Security Council|NSC]] cutout used for funneling money to pay its board of directors. [[Eugene Giaquinto]], then president of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] home entertainment division, was a board member of MIL.[1]
*   **Meridian Arms:** A subsidiary of MIL, where Nichols partnered with [[Michael Riconosciuto]]. They provided technical assistance to [[Wackenhut Corporation]] in the proposed development of esoteric armaments at the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation]].[1]
*   **R.B.N. Companies, International:** Nichols was the Chief Executive Officer of this holding company, involved in manufacturing and development of high technology electronics, real estate development, construction, and international finance.[1]

### Alleged Activities and Controversies

Nichols' activities spanned a wide range of illicit and covert operations, often intertwined with intelligence agencies and organized crime:

*   **Drug Trafficking and Money Laundering:** He was under investigation by the Los Angeles [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] as a suspected "international launderer of money derived from both narcotics and organized crime activities." His telex number (652483 RBN ASSOCS LSA) was linked to financial transactions in Lebanon. Nichols was associated with the illegal transportation of narcotics through the [[Golden Triangle]] and was described as a "bigtime drug dealer" operating overseas, using a rum importing business as a cover for heroin trafficking. He was also named as "Mr. Big" in the [[Medellin Cartel]] in drug prosecutions. [[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed Nichols handled gold transfers, money laundering, and "virtual dead drops" for various underworld figures, including [[Gilbert Rodriguez]] and [[Jose Londono]] of the [[Cali Drug Cartel]].[1]
*   **Intelligence Operations:** Nichols reportedly worked as a contract operative for the [[National Security Council|NSC]] at the time of [[Danny Casolaro]]'s death. He was considered a valuable asset in U.S. intelligence circles, providing "service for money" to any government agency. He assisted [[Ignacio Paz]] of the Philippine government in removing large sums of money from the Philippines by investing it in Swiss bank accounts. He was also involved in a [[National Security Council|NSC]]-directed drug operation in Lebanon through Euramae Trading Company, where heroin flow was maintained to preserve the credibility of intelligence operations.[1]
*   **Organized Crime Connections:** Nichols was linked to [[La Cosa Nostra]], specifically the [[Gambino Crime Family]] and [[Bufalino Crime Family]], and the [[Yakuza]]. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretaps on [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] recorded his communications with [[Eugene Giaquinto]], who had a close working relationship with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]]. He was also alleged to be the "godson" of [[Harold Okimoto]], a figure believed to be a top Japanese organized crime figure based in Hawaii.[1]
*   **Arms Dealing:** Nichols was involved in proposed arms projects, including the construction of an R&D facility for weapons systems on the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation]]. He was also involved with [[Michael Riconosciuto]] in proposals to FMC Corporation for advanced military technologies. He was described as a weapons technical advisor for Steven Seagal's movie *Under Siege*.[1]
*   **Relationship with Danny Casolaro:** Casolaro spent hundreds of hours on the phone with Nichols during his investigation into "[[The Octopus]]." Nichols reportedly warned Casolaro to drop his investigation and even flew to Martinsburg to convince him of the danger. Casolaro confronted Nichols about his connection to [[Michael Abbell]] and the [[Cali Drug Cartel]] shortly before his death. Nichols wrote a manuscript titled "Danny Casolaro's Octopus" after Casolaro's death, suggesting he believed Casolaro was murdered.[1]

### Investigations and Legal Status

Despite numerous allegations and investigations, [[Robert Booth Nichols]] reportedly had no arrest record. Investigations into his activities, including [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretaps, were often abruptly shut down by the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] when they approached high-level organized crime and drug connections.[1]
