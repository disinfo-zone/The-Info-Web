Claiborne Pell (1918â€“2009) was a powerful Democratic Senator from Rhode Island and a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A former [[Foreign Service]] officer who had worked behind enemy lines in Nazi-occupied Hungary, Pell was a firm supporter and proponent of [[Extrasensory Perception|extrasensory perception]] and the [[Remote Viewing]] program[^1].

Pell actively lobbied for the program's survival, reaching out personally to [[Dale Graff]] to offer his support. His interest stemmed from a belief in the potential operational value of psychic abilities for military intelligence[^1].

In 1987, Pell asked [[Uri Geller]] to come to Washington for a classified meeting on Capitol Hill. The meeting, which took place in the Capitol building's Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, involved Geller demonstrating his abilities, including [[Telepathy|telepathy]] and spoon bending, to senators and other officials[^1].

Pell also played a role in the 1987 Geneva disarmament talks. He was present at a reception where Geller was instructed to try and influence [[Yuli M. Vorontsov]], Russia's first deputy foreign minister and lead Soviet arms negotiator, to sign the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF treaty]]. Seven days later, [[Ronald Reagan]] announced that the Soviet Union had offered to move ahead with an agreement to cut longer-range INF missiles[^1].
