[[Reza Hashemi]] was one of the [[Hashemi brothers]], an [[Iran|Iranian]] living in the [[USA|West]]. He was involved in secret arms sales and negotiations concerning the [[USA|American]] hostages in [[Tehran]].[^1]

[[Reza Hashemi|Hashemi]] was arrested after his brothers, [[Cyrus Hashemi]] and [[Jamshid Hashemi]], were tipped off about their indictment under the [[Arms Export Control Act]] for illegal arms sales to [[Iran]]. He became a hostage himself, which pressured his elder brothers to negotiate with [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]] to become informants.[^1]
