William Perry served as the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. He was involved in the debate surrounding the [[U.S. Army]]'s involvement in [[Remote Viewing]] and [[Parapsychology|psychic research]][^1].

Perry stated in a memo that it was "not appropriate for Army to fund technology programs aimed at scientific development of parapsychology."[^1].
