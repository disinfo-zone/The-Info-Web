[[Arnold Overoye]] was an individual in the [[California Attorney General's Office|State Attorney General's Office]] in Sacramento. He initially agreed with Assistant [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[James White]] that [[Roderick Sinclair]] should be prosecuted in connection with the "Queen's accident." However, when the original [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] report crossed [[John Van de Kamp]]'s desk, Van de Kamp told Overoye and his assistant to "discard" or "trash" it.[^1]

Overoye's "procedure" of referring complaints directly back to local agencies was noted as a consistent practice, leading to threats, intimidation, and fear for complaining individuals in Mariposa County. This practice, along with the inaction of [[John Van de Kamp]] and federal agencies, reportedly extended to a number of foothill counties experiencing similar local corruption.[^1]
