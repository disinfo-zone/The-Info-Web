[[Miles Copeland]] was a well-known retired [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer. In December 1979, he gathered a group of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-connected officers and associates who were unhappy with the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] leadership.[^1]

[[Miles Copeland|Copeland]] had previously helped [[Kermit Roosevelt]] and the [[Iran|Iranian]] military restore the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah]] of [[Iran]] to power in 1953 after he had been overthrown by [[Mohammed Mossadegh]]. He was a friend of the late [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and was known for his anti-[[Israel|Israel]] stance. [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence believed him responsible for [[USA|U.S.]] pressure on [[Israel]], [[Britain]], and [[France]] to withdraw from the [[Suez Canal]] area in 1956, and for pushing [[Israel|Israelis]] to withdraw from the [[Sinai Desert|Sinai]].[^1]

[[Miles Copeland|Copeland's]] group, along with the [[Israel|Israeli]] government, sought to prevent the [[Iran|Iranians]] from being defeated in [[Khuzistan]] if [[Iraq]] attacked, and to avoid a repeat of [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter's]] blunders. A meeting between [[Miles Copeland|Copeland]] and [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence officers, including [[David Kimche]], was held in [[Washington D.C.]].[^1]
