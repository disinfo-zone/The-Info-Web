# Allan H. Frey

Allan H. Frey is a biologist known for his research into the effects of microwave radiation on the human body. Since 1960, he has worked on both classified and unclassified [[Department of Defense]] contracts, including those with the [[Office of Naval Research]] and the [[U.S. Army]][^1].

In 1961, Frey discovered a radical new technology, later termed [[Synthetic Telepathy]], where a microwave input signal allowed the brain to perceive a message as a voice transmission, even though it was a microwave beam. He posited that living organisms are "complex electrochemical systems that evolved over billions of years in a world with a relatively simple weak magnetic field." His work focused on understanding the effects of [[Electromagnetic Energy|electromagnetic energy]] on biological systems, noting that the world now "glows with electromagnetic (em) energy emissions"[^1].

Frey criticized the "glib assumptions that government scientists had a complete understanding of the nervous system function," arguing that such assumptions were wrong and led to misunderstandings in the field[^1]. He also highlighted the issue of atrocious translations in Russian papers on this subject, which often led to their rejection as "uninterpretable"[^1].

His research added further resonance to the mysterious links between [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]], [[Psychokinesis|PK]], and [[Electromagnetic Weapons]], which were actively studied by the [[Soviet Union|Russians]]. In the late 1960s, Frey reported that he could speed up, slow down, or stop an excised frog heart by synchronizing the pulse rate of a microwave beam with the heart itself, an experiment that echoed what [[Ninel Kulagina]] was reported to have done with her mind[^1].
