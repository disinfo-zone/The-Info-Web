[[Jerry Goldberg]] was a reporter for *Capitol News Service* in Sacramento. He wrote a story on February 17, 1988, entitled, "Law & Order Failing on Hill County," which discussed the corruption in Mariposa County. Goldberg noted that *Capitol News Service* had discussions with several Attorney General staff members who "stonewalled questions" about any investigation or willingness to meet with [[D.I.G. (Decency in Government)|D.I.G.]].[^1]

Goldberg's article mentioned the "[[Queen's Accident]]" and threats received by individuals who spoke out against the sheriff and district attorney. He also noted that a San Joaquin County official stated a key element to the problems in Mariposa County related to the fatal accident involving Queen Elizabeth's escort vehicle.[^1]

Goldberg reportedly disappeared the day after [[Ben Wagner]]'s meeting with "Chuck" from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] [[White House]], leaving his law practice and home, never to be seen again.[^1]
