Robert Bratt was the Executive Officer for the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]'s Criminal Division. He was involved in the investigation of [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]'s allegations regarding the [[Office of Special Investigations|OSI]] and the Criminal Division Vendor List.

Inslaw alleged that the Criminal Division Vendor List was actually a list of commercial organizations and individuals serving as "cutouts" for a secret DOJ intelligence agency, the [[Office of Special Investigations|OSI]]. The Special Counsel's investigation showed this list to Robert Bratt. Bratt confirmed that the list was exactly what it purported to be: a list of vendors used by the Criminal Division. He explained that the Criminal Division had been using an automated system called PROCURE for requesting goods and services since the beginning of the 1993 fiscal year, and that the list was simply a copy of the master list of Criminal Division vendors. The Special Counsel concluded that the vendor list was nothing other than what it claimed to be, and that the theory that large companies were fronts for OSI's covert operations was unsupported.[^1]
