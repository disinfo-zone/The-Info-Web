[[Amin Gamayel]] served as the president of [[Lebanon]], succeeding his brother [[Bashir Gemayel]] who was assassinated before taking office. His family, the Gamayels, were a powerful Christian family who sought outside forces for money, guns, and political support, notably turning to the international heroin trafficking network.[^1]

Gamayel received a letter from [[George K. Pender]], President of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]], dated July 12, 1983, discussing [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]]'s interest in arranging financing for the redevelopment of [[Lebanon]]. The letter also mentioned Pender's previous visits to Beirut and meetings with figures like [[Maurice Ghanem]] and Mourad Baroudy. Pender's letter listed [[Robert Booth Nichols]]' telex number for responses.[^1]
