Rudolf Cordes was a West German hostage who was released by terrorists in September 1988. During his captivity, he had seen Marine Lieutenant Colonel [[William Richard Higgins]] alive shortly after his capture in [[Lebanon]][^1].

In a debriefing with a U.S. official, Cordes confirmed that Higgins had been held captive in a specially constructed shed. He also confirmed that this small structure was "very likely near" the barren location that [[Angela Dellafiora]], a [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] remote viewer, had identified as Higgins's location shortly after his capture[^1].
