Brigadier General James L. Dozier was a senior [[U.S. Army]] official and deputy chief of staff in the [[NATO]] Southern Command. On December 17, 1981, he was kidnapped from his penthouse apartment in Verona, [[Italy]], by the [[Red Brigades]], a Marxist-Leninist paramilitary group[^1].

Dozier, a graduate of [[West Point]] and a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, was reading a letter when his doorbell rang. Two young men, posing as plumbers, gained entry to his apartment. Dozier was attacked, and he and his wife, Judy, were bound and gagged. Dozier was then forced into a steamer trunk and secreted away in the back of a blue Fiat van[^1].

His abduction triggered a massive international response. The [[FBI]] offered a $2 million reward for information, and a Joint Special Operations Command team was dispatched to Italy. In Washington, [[Dale Graff]] and the [[Grill Flame]] remote viewers at [[Fort Meade]] were tasked with providing intelligence to locate him[^1].

Remote viewers, including [[Joe McMoneagle]], [[Hartleigh Trent]], and [[Ken Bell]], provided information that Dozier was still alive and in the same place. However, the information was often vague and disparate, making it difficult to pinpoint his exact location[^1].

Graff himself experienced vivid dreams and impressions, believing Dozier was held "upstairs in a room above a grocery store" in Padua. This information, combined with intelligence from a U.S. signals intelligence team, led Italian police to the exact street address where Dozier was being held[^1].

After 42 days in captivity, Dozier was rescued on January 28, 1982, by ten men from Italy's Central Operative Security Nucleus who stormed the apartment. He was found alive and was flown home to a hero's welcome, including an invitation to the [[White House]] from [[Ronald Reagan]][^1].

Despite the remote viewers' involvement, Dozier later stated that he finally figured out where he was being held by listening to voices and realizing that groceries were being sold. He called psychic functioning "pure nonsense"[^1].
