[[Ron Williams]] was a Secret Service agent who had ridden in the third car of Queen Elizabeth II's motorcade in 1983, during the "[[Queen's accident]]." His best friend was the driver of the car in which all three Secret Service agents were killed. Williams arrived in Mariposa to enlist [[Cheri Seymour]]'s help in putting the pieces of the puzzle together on the accident.[^1]

Williams was the man who had tried to pull [[Roderick Sinclair]] out of the sheriff's vehicle on the day of the accident. There had been a scuffle, with [[Dave Beavers]] insisting that Sinclair go to the hospital with "his own people," and the Secret Service ultimately conceding. Williams sadly reflected that they did not know to ask the hospital for blood tests on Sinclair that day, nor did they know of his drug use. By the time the case went to court, the records at the hospital were gone.[^1]

[[Don Thrasher]], a producer for ABC News 20/20, interviewed Williams, who corroborated the profile of [[Roderick Sinclair]]'s father as a military attaché to [[Douglas MacArthur]] during [[World War II]]. Williams also confirmed that Colonel Sinclair (Sr.) supervised the training of selected Japanese in intelligence gathering operations in [[Japan]] after the war, and that Rod Sinclair, Jr. attended school in [[Japan]] and later reportedly worked in the Army C.I.D.[^1]
