Simcha Dinitz was the Israeli ambassador to [[Washington D.C.]] During the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]], he made a series of urgent telephone calls to [[Henry A. Kissinger]], then Secretary of State, focusing on the need for resupply for the Israeli military. Dinitz's insistence on a one-on-one meeting with Kissinger, where he reportedly conveyed [[Golda Meir]]'s willingness to come to the [[United States]] personally to plead for arms aid, was described by Kissinger as potentially "hysteria or blackmail."[^1]
