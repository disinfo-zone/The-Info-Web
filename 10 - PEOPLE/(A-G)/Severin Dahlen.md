Severin Dahlen was a metallurgist who collaborated with [[Jack Houck]], a Boeing Aerospace engineer, on research into [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]] (PK) and metal bending. They investigated whether the ability to bend metal with the mind had a connection to one's belief system and the concept of *[[Qi]]*[^1].

Dahlen participated in Houck's spoon-bending parties, where he analyzed the results from a metallurgist's point of view. His conclusion was that "Stainless flatware seems to be the easiest metal to [bend] with PK. This is because of [the]metallurgical characteristics of stainless steel. Stainless flatware is usually stamped out in large quantities. The process of cold stamping creates a large number of ‘dislocations’ along the grain boundaries in the metal. The PK energy is somehow dumped into the metal and these dislocations act as beacons for that energy. Once the PK energy lands at a dislocation, there is nowhere for it to go and it turns into heat, much as when neutrons and X-rays penetrate solid objects"[^1].
