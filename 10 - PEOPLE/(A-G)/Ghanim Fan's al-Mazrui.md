Ghanim Fan's al-Mazrui was the Head of [[Zayed bin Sultan AL-Nahayan|Sheikh Zayed]]'s Private Department and a [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] board member.[^1] He was also the director general of His Highness's Private Department and a longtime director of BCCI, effectively running [[Abu Dhabi]] alongside Sheikh Zayed.[^2]

### Role in BCCI Operations

Al-Mazrui's involvement with BCCI was significant, particularly in the bank's relationship with the Abu Dhabi government. He was a key figure in the discussions surrounding the restructuring of BCCI, especially after the bank faced financial difficulties.[^3]

He was also connected to [[William Casey]], the former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Director, through the [[Bank of Oman]], which was a major affiliate of BCCI and channeled funds for the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] freedom fighters.[^4]

Al-Mazrui's involvement in the BCCI scandal was a matter of public knowledge, and his actions were closely scrutinized during the investigations into the bank's illicit activities.[^5]
