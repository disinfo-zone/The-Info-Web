Luis “Lue” Elizondo is an important [[UAP]] personality most known for running the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) for the [[Department of Defense]]. Lue had a long distinguished military career leading to this appointment, but is now allegedly retired from the government and pursuing UAP disclosure. In August 2024, he published his insider story [[Imminent]].

## Early Life
Lue was born around XXXX in [placeholder], Texas to Cuban exile [[Luis Elizondo III]] and American [[Janise]]. The family moved to Sarasota around 1975 and opened an Italian restaurant called Michelangelo’s in 1978[^1]. His parents eventually divorced when Lue was 10.

Luis Elizondo III, Lue’s father, was a revolutionary fighting first with Castro and then against him with the CIA and he tried to pass this knowledge on to his son. Lue was trained to drive cars, motorcycles, fly planes, assemble guns, build bombs, navigate wilderness, etc as a young boy.

Lue went to Hebrew school at his mother’s urging. He writes that he was constantly bullied as a child and scared of his father’s temper. Lue struggled in school due to dyslexia and frequently got into fights until he was urged to join JROTC and found solace in the mixed company and structure the organization provided.

He ultimately graduated high school and attended University of Miami studying premed with a focus on microbiology and immunology.

During this period he met [[Jennifer]] whom he eventually married and would later have at least one child with.

## Army Years
After college and craving the structure of JROTC, Lue joined the [[U.S. Army]] opting to join as an enlisted man instead of an officer so he could select his MOS. He was trained as a counterintelligence special agent (97-Bravo).

The Army first assigned him to South Korea where he worked with the [[Korean CIA]] (KCIA) and [[Korean National Police]] (KNP) as well as with Special Projects surveillance team.

Upon his return to the United States, he was reassigned to the [[902nd MI Group]] and stationed to Fort Huachuca, Arizona working on counter intelligence for Nevada, California, and Arizona to protect the major defense contractors working in the area ([[TRW]], [[Raytheon]], [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed]], etc). During this period he relates an interesting story about codename [[Lone Wolf on the Range]][^2].

### Remote Viewing
A year after his reassignment, Lue was approached by Lieutenant Colonel [[Michael Seage]] for an Army program called [[Great Skill Program|Great Skill]]. Through this he was introduced to [[Eugene Lessman]], a civilian intelligence officer employed by the Army. Gene helped train Lue to perform [[remote viewing]] but ultimately told him the program was cancelled (Editors Opinion, it was not cancelled, Lue just wasn’t an adept).

## Army Civilian Intelligence Personnel

Lue then was released from the Army and was reassigned to Panama as an intelligence operations officer[^3].
