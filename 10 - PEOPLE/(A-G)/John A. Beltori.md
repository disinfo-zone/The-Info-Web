John A. Beltori was identified by [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] as a witness whose testimony provided circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy involving [[Earl Brian]] and [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] officials to steal the [[PROMIS]] software. The Special Counsel's investigation, however, found no credible evidence to support this claim.[^1]
