[[Shaula Brent]] was a manager at B. Dalton Bookseller. She had previously worked at Fremont Hospital when [[Roderick Sinclair]] was brought in after the "Queen's accident." Brent recounted that Sinclair was placed in a room with an armed guard and had been receiving huge daily shots of Demerol, ordered by [[Dr. Arthur Dahlem]], prior to the accident. She noted that the amount of Demerol would have killed most men. After the accident, all drugs were withdrawn from Sinclair, and employees could hear him suffering aloud for days.[^1]

Brent and her friend, [[Barbara Locke]], who also worked at the hospital, were suspicious about Sinclair's hospital records. They secretly took photostats of the records "before they were destroyed by the hospital." Brent stated that blood had been drawn on Sinclair on the day of the "Queen's accident," and he had been under the influence. She provided the names of six nurses who witnessed Sinclair's condition.[^1]
