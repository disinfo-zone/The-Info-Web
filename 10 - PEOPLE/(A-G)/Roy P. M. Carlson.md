### Early Career and BCCI Involvement

Carlson was a key figure in the early relationship between Bank of America and BCCI.

### Role at National Bank of Georgia

The National Bank of Georgia became a clearinghouse for BCCI funds in the United States, a destination for BCCI letters of credit, and a provider of loans and services to BCCI's international clientele.[^7]

Carlson played a role in the acquisition of [[Financial General Bankshares]], negotiating the purchase for First American Bank.[^8]
