Kenneth A. Kress was a physicist, engineer, and analyst with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. He is considered by some to be the "father of America's remote-viewing program" as he was responsible for giving [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] its first [[Psi]] research contract in 1972[^1]. Kress, then a young, dark-haired engineer, was instrumental in bringing [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Ingo Swann]] into the [[CIA]]'s orbit for psychic research[^1].

Kress was the lead analyst assigned to the operation involving [[Pat Price]]'s [[Remote Viewing]] of [[URDF-3]], a highly classified [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] research and development facility in [[Kazakhstan]][^1]. In July 1974, after Price remotely viewed URDF-3, Kress compared Price's descriptions to classified satellite imagery. He found that reconnaissance photographs confirmed the presence of rails for railroad cars and a huge crane, as described by Price. However, some details, like the spheres Price mentioned, were not locatable, which agitated the [[CIA]][^1].

Kress flew to [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] to brief [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] on URDF-3 and to get additional information from Price. When Kress met Price in person, he tested him by asking if Price knew him. Price correctly identified Kress by name and stated his occupation as working for the [[CIA]], which was significant as Kress was a covert employee[^1]. Kress also questioned Price about details he missed, such as four derricks. Price responded that he didn't see them because "they are not there anymore," a statement that was later corroborated when rechecked reconnaissance data showed the derricks partially disassembled[^1].

Despite the accuracy of some of Price's information, Kress noted that Price also produced bad data. He also became concerned about the possibility of a [[KGB]] disinformation campaign, suggesting that Price could have been supplied data for disinformation purposes. This led Kress to question his own objectivity, as he observed that individuals who supported pro-paranormal data often had "conversion" experiences[^1].

Kress played a crucial role in the early stages of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program, particularly as a handler for [[Pat Price]]. He was involved in presenting Price with targets and evaluating his remote viewing data. Kress, along with [[Peter Maris]], was the [[CIA]] official who tasked Price with remote viewing the secret Soviet military research facility at Semipalatinsk (URDF-3), a session that yielded remarkably accurate details later confirmed by satellite photography. Kress and Maris initially didn't know what to make of Price's descriptions of a large crane and metal spheres, but later confirmed them with satellite photos, which became a key piece of evidence for the program's effectiveness[^1].

He also worked closely with [[Norm Everheart]], encouraging him to explore how remote viewing could assist Staff D operations. Kress was present during Price's three tests for Staff D, witnessing Price's accurate remote viewing of the Chinese Embassy in Africa and the Chinese consular building in Rome. He also served as a liaison for [[Uri Geller]]'s visits to [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]], and was the recipient of information from [[Hal Puthoff]] regarding Geller's activities and potential security concerns[^1].

At Kress's suggestion, the [[CIA]] contracted with an outside scientist to evaluate the psychic research program, who concluded that "a large body of reliable experimental evidence points to the inescapable conclusion that [[Extrasensory Perception|extrasensory perception]] does exist as a real phenomenon, albeit characterized by rarity and lack of reliability"[^1].
