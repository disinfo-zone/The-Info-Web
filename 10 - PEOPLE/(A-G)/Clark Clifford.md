### Political and Legal Career

Clifford arrived in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1945 as a naval aide at the White House.[^3] He was a principal architect of "Fair Deal" politics and a co-author of the [[National Security Act of 1947]], which established the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[National Security Council]].[^4] He was a key figure in the creation of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and participated in the formulation of the [[Truman Doctrine]], a policy of Soviet containment.[^5]

He advised [[John F. Kennedy]] after the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] and served as Secretary of Defense under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], leading efforts to extricate the United States from [[Vietnam]].[^6] Clifford also counseled [[Jimmy Carter]] on the [[Panama Canal Treaty]] and acted as his special envoy to Greece, Turkey, and India.[^7]

After leaving government service, Clifford maintained a private law practice, representing major corporations such as Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, Time Incorporated, and General Electric.[^8] He was known for his ability to navigate political complexities and his influence in Washington.[^9]

### Involvement with BCCI

Clifford became involved with BCCI through his association with [[Bert Lance]], who introduced him to [[Agha Hasan Abedi]].[^10] Clifford and his law partner, [[Robert Altman]], were instrumental in BCCI's secret acquisition of [[Financial General Bankshares]], which later became First American Bank.[^11] They served as BCCI's lead counsel in the United States and were paid substantial legal fees for their work.[^12]

Clifford and Altman were accused of lying to U.S. banking regulators about BCCI's secret ownership of First American Bank.[^13] In February 1988, they sold a large portion of their First American stock to a BCCI front man, making significant profits.[^14] This transaction occurred amidst growing scrutiny of BCCI's activities.

In July 1992, Clifford and Altman were indicted by a New York grand jury on charges of bribery and fraud related to their involvement with BCCI.[^15]
