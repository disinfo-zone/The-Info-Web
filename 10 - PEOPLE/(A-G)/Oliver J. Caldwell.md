Oliver J. Caldwell was a former [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] officer who was known to run operations for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. He is cited in [[John L. LaMothe]]'s 1972 report, *Controlled Offensive Behaviorâ€”USSR*, regarding the perceived [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] psychoenergetic threat[^1].

Caldwell expressed significant concern about the Soviet advancements in [[Parapsychology|parapsychology]] and psychic warfare. He told LaMothe, "I am really disturbed... because if the [[United States]] does not make a serious effort to move forward on this new frontier, in another ten years it may be too late"[^1]. His statement underscored the urgency felt by some within the U.S. intelligence community to counter perceived Soviet capabilities in [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]][^1].
