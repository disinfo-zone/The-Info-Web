Nikolai Bulganin was a Soviet politician who served as the Premier of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1955 to 1958. During the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, he explicitly warned [[David Ben-Gurion]] that the [[Soviet Union]] was capable of attacking with "remote-controlled vehicles" and threatened to send troops as "volunteers" into the [[Middle East]]. This warning, perceived as a nuclear ultimatum, contributed to [[Britain]] and [[France]]'s decision to cease their military actions and forced [[Israel]] to agree to a cease-fire.[^1]
