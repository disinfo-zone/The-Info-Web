Allen Dulles served as the Director of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] from 1953 to 1961. He, along with his brother [[John Foster Dulles]], the Secretary of State, were infuriated by [[Israel]]'s attempt to mask the extent of its military buildup prior to the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. He was regularly present at White House briefings where intelligence from [[U-2 Spy Plane|U-2]] flights, including early information on [[Dimona]], was presented.[^1]
