[[Henry Grunwald]] was the editor-in-chief of *Time* magazine. He was responsible for vetoing the publication of [[Raji Samghabadi|Samghabadi's]] story detailing the [[Oliver North|North]]-[[Amiram Nir|Nir]] operation, which later became known as the [[Iran-Contra Affair]]. This decision was seen by some as an example of media control in the [[USA|U.S.]].[^1]
