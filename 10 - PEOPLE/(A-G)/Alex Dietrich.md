Lieutenant Commander [[Alex Dietrich]] is a U.S. Navy pilot who was one of the key eyewitnesses to the 2004 [[Tic Tac Incident]] involving the [[USS Nimitz]] Carrier Strike Group. Her testimony, along with that of her commanding officer, Commander [[Dave Fravor]], has been crucial in validating the incident and bringing the issue of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) to the forefront.[^1]

### The Tic Tac Encounter

On November 14, 2004, Lieutenant Commander Dietrich, then a Lieutenant Junior Grade, was the pilot of the second F/A-18 Super Hornet that was diverted to investigate the anomalous radar contacts being tracked by the [[USS Princeton]]. Flying alongside Commander [[Dave Fravor]], she witnessed the white, oblong craft, later nicknamed the "Tic Tac," maneuvering erratically over a disturbance in the ocean.[^1]

Dietrich and her WSO, "Noodle," observed the object as Fravor descended to engage it. She corroborated Fravor's account of the Tic Tac's impossible acceleration and disappearance. Her description of the object's behavior as "playful" has been noted by investigators as a recurring theme in some UAP encounters.[^1]

### Role in Disclosure

Like Commander Fravor, Dietrich was initially hesitant to speak about the encounter due to the stigma surrounding the UAP topic. However, she was eventually debriefed by [[Luis Elizondo]] and [[Christopher Mellon]] and agreed to share her story. Her credible testimony as a highly skilled naval aviator has been a significant factor in the legitimization of the UAP issue. She has provided briefings to members of Congress and their staff, contributing to the growing momentum for UAP transparency and investigation within the U.S. government.[^1]
