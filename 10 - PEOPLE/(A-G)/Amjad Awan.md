Amjad Awan was a manager of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] [[Panama]] and later the bank's marketing manager for Latin America and the Caribbean.[^1] He gained notoriety as [[Manuel Noriega]]'s personal banker, handling his accounts and facilitating illicit financial transactions.[^2]

### Role in BCCI's Operations

Awan was deeply involved in BCCI's efforts to hide illicit financial transactions and manage accounts for high-net-worth criminal clients.[^3] He facilitated the movement of money for drug cartels and maintained a close relationship with Noriega, who was looting his own country.[^4] Awan also told investigators that BCCI secretly owned and controlled [[First American Bank]] and other United States banks.[^5]

In October 1988, Awan was arrested by American Customs agents in Tampa, Florida, as part of a sting operation targeting money laundering and narcotics trafficking.[^6] He was convicted of money laundering but never testified at his trial.[^7] Despite his conviction, Awan's testimony and cooperation with investigators were crucial in revealing the extent of BCCI's criminal enterprise.

### Connections and Legal Proceedings

Awan's connections extended to high-level figures within BCCI and beyond. He was in contact with [[Swaleh Naqvi]], BCCI's chief operating officer, and was advised by [[Clark Clifford]] and [[Robert Altman]], BCCI's chief American counsel, to shred documents and leave the United States.[^8]

His case was part of a larger investigation into BCCI's money laundering activities, which eventually led to the bank pleading guilty in Tampa in 1990.[^9]
