Bernard Baruch was an American financier and statesman. In the late summer of 1939, he collaborated with [[Lewis L. Strauss]] on a proposal to convince the British government to cede a large tract of colonial [[Africa]] for resettlement by European refugees, both Jewish and non-Jewish. They believed that as much as $300 million could be raised for this purpose, but it was ultimately too late to prevent the impending Nazi blitzkrieg.[^1]
