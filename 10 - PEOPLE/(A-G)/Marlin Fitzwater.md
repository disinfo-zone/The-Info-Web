Marlin Fitzwater was the [[White House]] press secretary under President [[Ronald Reagan]]. In May 1988, he confirmed the revelation made by [[Donald T. Regan]], former White House chief of staff, that President Reagan had sought the advice of a private astrologer during his tenure[^1].

Fitzwater stated that "President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, are both deeply interested in astrology," thereby publicly acknowledging the role of [[Joan Quigley]], the San Francisco socialite and astrologer, in the President's decision-making process[^1].
