[[Rudolph Giuliani]] was the [[USA|U.S.]] Attorney for the Southern District of [[New York]]. He was involved in the [[Hashemi sting]] operation, which was designed to entrap individuals connected with [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence arms sales to [[Iran]].[^1]

[[Rudolph Giuliani|Giuliani]], along with [[William von Raab]], the [[United States Customs Service|Customs]] Commissioner, gave joint TV interviews on April 22, 1986, announcing the arrest of a "huge ring of terrorists" and "Merchants of Death" who were supposedly about to sell arms worth a billion dollars to [[Iran]]. [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] claims that [[Rudolph Giuliani|Giuliani]] and his associates had created the crime themselves.[^1]
