James L. Byrnes was employed by the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] during 1986 as an Associate Deputy Attorney General to then Deputy Attorney General [[Arnold Burns]]. In November 1987, Byrnes transferred to the Land and Natural Resources Division of the DOJ, explaining that he was interested in environmental law and wanted to practice in a line division.

[[Bill Hamilton]]'s affidavit alleged that Byrnes, who had "close ties to [[Edwin Meese]]," spearheaded the award by the DOJ in October 1987 of a $40 million computer services contract for litigation support in that Division to a [[Hadron]] subsidiary. Byrnes denied any knowledge of the awarding of such a contract and stated he had no knowledge of, or contact with, Hadron, [[Simeon]], [[Accumenics]], or any Hadron subsidiary. He recognized the name [[Earl Brian]] but said he had never met him. Byrnes denied having or ever having "close ties" with former Attorney General Edwin Meese, though he was interviewed by Meese when initially seeking DOJ employment and often attended meetings where Meese was present. He stated he never discussed [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]] or Earl Brian with Meese. The Special Counsel's investigation found no evidence to support Hamilton's allegations regarding Byrnes's involvement in a conspiracy.[^1]
