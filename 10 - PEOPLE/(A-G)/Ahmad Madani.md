Admiral [[Ahmad Madani]] was a significant figure in the [[Iran|Iranian]] military and politics. In the 1960s, he was the youngest admiral in the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah's]] navy. He was forced to resign in 1970 due to alleged corruption, though in fact, it was because he was becoming too outspoken in his criticism of the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah's]] regime.[^1]

After the [[Iranian Revolution]] in February 1979, [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] restored him to commander of the navy and appointed him defense minister. In April 1979, he left the post of defense minister to become the governor of the strategic [[Khuzistan]] province on the [[Iraq|Iraqi]] border. He remained a close adviser to [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] on all defense-related matters.[^1]

[[Ahmad Madani|Madani]] was defeated by [[Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr]] in the election for the first president of [[Iran]] after the revolution.[^1]
