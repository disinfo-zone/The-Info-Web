[[Edward Sciandra]], also known as The Conductor, was alleged in [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] files to be the Underboss of the [[Bufalino Crime Family|Russell Bufalino La Cosa Nostra (LCN) family]]. He was under investigation in 1987 for various suspected offenses, including extortion, insider trading ([[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]/Universal), the purchase and sale of narcotics/controlled substances, and the allocation and use of the proceeds of its trafficking.[^1]

Sciandra was mentioned in [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretaps, which captured conversations between [[Eugene Giaquinto]] and [[Martin Bacow]]. Bacow indicated that Sciandra wanted to go to [[Lew Wasserman]] and [[Sidney Sheinberg]] (President of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]) and tell them who they were up against. Giaquinto replied that perhaps Sheinberg would "break a toe" and end up in the hospital, or "maybe he'll break a leg."[^1]

The intercept narration suggested that this stemmed from problems with the Northstar Graphics contract, and the [[La Cosa Nostra|LCN]] believed Sciandra was being irrational and should be "retired." If Sciandra threatened [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] executives, it would cause trouble for his nephew, [[Eugene Giaquinto]], who worked for [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. Sciandra was also reportedly trying to get a piece of Giaquinto's share of the [[Meyer Lansky|Lansky]] film.[^1]
