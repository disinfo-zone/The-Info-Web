[[Calvin Robinson]] was dubbed the "drug tug" captain by local media. He was represented by attorney [[David Mayer]] of Marin County, [[California]]. Robinson's tug was seized in the San Francisco Bay in the Spring of 1988, found hauling a barge containing 157 tons of hashish and marijuana.[^1]

On December 12, 1991, Robinson filed a "Pro Per" affidavit in the [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]], Northern District of [[California]], requesting that Judge [[John Paul Vukasin, Jr.]] be recused from his case. Robinson believed that Vukasin was a long-time associate and political ally of [[Edwin Meese III]] and that Vukasin was appointed to the district court bench as a "damage control agent" for Meese and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]].[^1]

Robinson's affidavit for recusal also stated that he obtained the assistance of attorney [[David Mayer]] to represent him at his 1989 trial, but Mayer died from a gun-shot wound the night before he was to appear in court to defend Robinson. Mayer's death was ruled a suicide, and a suicide tape was found.[^1]

[[Sean McDade]] interviewed Robinson in prison. Robinson reportedly had some connection to a former [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]] official and the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation]], but McDade's investigation was closed before he could prove the connection.[^1]
