Lincoln D. Faurer was a Lieutenant General and the Director of the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). In the spring of 1982, he was given a briefing on the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[Remote Viewing]] program, and he saw [[Extrasensory Perception|extrasensory perception]] as a form of [[Signals Intelligence|signals intelligence]] with potential operational value[^1].

Faurer's interest led him to assign the remote-viewing unit at [[Fort Meade]] a dozen new tasks in April 1982. His support was crucial for the program's survival, as it provided the necessary operational requests from the military and intelligence services[^1].
