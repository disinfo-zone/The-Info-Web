[[Irving Azoff]] was in charge of the record division of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]. He was mentioned in [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretaps, which captured conversations between [[Eugene Giaquinto]] and [[Martin Bacow]]. On June 30, 1987, Giaquinto told Bacow that Azoff was "planning to take over the whole thing."[^1]

On July 24, phone conversations took place in which Azoff, [[Sal Pisello]], and the investigation of the record division of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] were discussed. Giaquinto said he was considering sending the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] board of directors an incriminating letter prepared in 1985 on behalf of Pisello, sent to Azoff, which would conflict with Azoff's testimony at the trial.[^1]

On July 12, Bacow asked Giaquinto if Azoff had something on [[Sidney Sheinberg]]. Giaquinto replied that it had been "bandied about" and he would know more when other documents came in. This was interpreted in the intercept as Giaquinto obtaining confidential government information from some government agency personnel in Washington D.C.[^1]
