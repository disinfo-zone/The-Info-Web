George A. Cowan was an American scientist who spent more than twenty years designing nuclear weapons at [[Los Alamos]]. He acknowledged that there was always a close association with Israeli physicists from the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], who visited the labs. Cowan believed that the Israelis were smart enough to do their own research and that the need for secret information was largely promoted by spy novelists.[^1]
