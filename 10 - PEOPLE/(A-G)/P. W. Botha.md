P. W. Botha was the Prime Minister of [[South Africa]]. On September 25, 1979, three days after a [[VELA Satellite]] recorded probable evidence of a nuclear explosion over the South Indian Ocean, Botha warned the Cape National Party congress that [[South Africa]] had and could produce sufficient arms to counter terrorism. He hinted that they might have military weapons that others did not know about, suggesting that [[South Africa]] and its Israeli partners had successfully conducted a secret nuclear test.[^1]
