Al Girard was the replacement for [[Dale Graff]] as the head of the [[Remote Viewing]] unit after Graff's retirement in June 1993. He took over leadership of the program during a period of significant turmoil and decline[^1].

Girard reportedly "thought the unit was totally out of control" and seemed to have inherited a situation "way beyond his comfort level." He was described as the kind of government official who wore a three-piece suit to work, suggesting a more conventional approach to his role[^1].

In the winter of 1994, Girard was involved in the court-martial proceedings against [[David Morehouse]], a former member of the remote-viewing unit. He asked [[Angela Dellafiora]] to accompany him to the [[Pentagon]] to meet with Morehouse's lawyer, and Dellafiora later testified as an expert witness on the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]'s remote-viewing program during Morehouse's preliminary court-martial hearing[^1].
