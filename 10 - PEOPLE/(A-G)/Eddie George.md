Eddie George was the Deputy Governor of the [[Bank of England]].[^1]

### Role in BCCI Scandal

George, along with Governor [[Robin Leigh-Pemberton]], was aware of the disastrous 1990 Price Waterhouse audit of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], which revealed that many of BCCI's transactions were "fraudulent and deceitful."[^2] Despite this knowledge, the Bank of England agreed to a plan in spring 1990 to allow BCCI to move its headquarters to [[Abu Dhabi]] and for [[Zayed bin Sultan AL-Nahayan|Sheikh Zayed]] to take over the bank.[^3] This action effectively concealed BCCI's problems from its depositors and creditors.[^4]

On June 28, 1991, George and Leigh-Pemberton decided to act, informing the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] of the impending seizure of BCCI in the [[United Kingdom]].[^5] This decision was influenced by the revelations in the Price Waterhouse audit and the certainty that [[Robert Morgenthau]] and the Fed would take action.[^6]
