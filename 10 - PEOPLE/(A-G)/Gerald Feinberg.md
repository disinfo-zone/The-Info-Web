Gerald Feinberg was a physics professor at [[Columbia University]]. He was working on hypotheses involving a subatomic particle called a [[Tachyon]], which is proposed to be superluminal, or faster-than-light[^1].

His work, along with that of [[Yakov Terletsky]], attracted the attention of [[Hal Puthoff]], who was interested in whether the tachyon flow could account for an "extra field" or force that physics couldn't yet see, potentially explaining [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and other anomalous mental phenomena[^1].
