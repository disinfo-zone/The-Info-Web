Anthony Eden was the Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom]] from 1955 to 1957. He was involved in the secret planning for the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, alongside [[Israel]] and [[France]]. The battle plan called for [[Israel]] to initiate the attack, followed by demands from [[France]] and [[Britain]] for a halt to hostilities and withdrawal from the [[Suez Canal]]. When [[Egypt]] refused, [[France]] and [[England]] would launch assaults to occupy the canal.[^1]

Eden, however, became anxious by the fast pace of the Israeli Army and the [[United Nations]] ceasefire call. He was the first to break ranks and ordered his troops to cease firing after the [[Soviet Union]] issued what was perceived in [[Israel]] to be a nuclear ultimatum. This decision, made under extreme pressure from the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration and the opposition Labor Party at home, led to [[Britain]]'s withdrawal from the conflict.[^1]
