[[Frank Chevrier]] was a French-Canadian who transformed [[FXC International]], a company that initially produced parachutes for civilian purposes. He started as a laborer at the company and eventually became its director and owner. Under his leadership, [[FXC International]] began manufacturing parachutes for military purposes with [[Israel|Israeli]] technology.[^1]

After [[Frank Chevrier|Chevrier]]'s fortunes changed and [[FXC International]] became a significant company, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] approached him with the idea of opening an aircraft division. This division would allow [[FXC International]] to broker secret sales of aircraft around the world on behalf of the [[USA|U.S.]] government.[^1]
