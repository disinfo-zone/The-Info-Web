[[Joseph Cuellar]] was a man who approached [[Danny Casolaro]] in a pub during the week prior to Casolaro's death. Cuellar claimed to be a Special Forces operative and offered to arrange a rendezvous between [[Peter Videnieks]] and Casolaro. Cuellar's connection to Videnieks allegedly came through Videnieks' wife, Barbara, who was the executive assistant to Senator [[Robert Byrd]].[^1]

Casolaro confided to friends that he was unnerved by this supposedly chance meeting. He met with Cuellar at other times that week, but it is unknown whether he ever spoke with Videnieks. Sources later suggested that Cuellar was a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] Major in an [[Army Intelligence Agency|Army intelligence]] unit who went to work for a company that was a [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] cutout. One [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent reported that Cuellar spoke Arabic fluently and had spent time in [[Iraq]].[^1]

[[Bill Hamilton]], president of [[INSLAW]], stated that he had received an affidavit from [[Bill Turner]] on "highly classified computer printouts on off-shore accounts that he claimed Casolaro intended to use the night he died in a planned meeting with [[Peter Videnieks]] and [[Joseph Cuellar]] and others."[^1]
