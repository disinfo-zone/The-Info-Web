[[Joseph R. (Mike) Benitez]] was the former [[Cabazon Tribal Council]] Chairman. On January 28, 1985, he wrote a two-page letter to President [[Ronald Reagan]], requesting an investigation of the [[Cabazon Casino]] and the [[Indio Bingo Palace]]. Benitez stated that "non-Indian investors" had not provided them with financial statements for four years and withheld information from the tribal members. He also noted that tribal members had been assessed taxes by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] on income of $270,000 each, but they never received any of this money.[^1]
