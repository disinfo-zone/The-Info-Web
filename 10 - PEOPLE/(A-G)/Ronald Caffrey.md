[[Ronald Caffrey]] was the acting assistant administrator of the operational division of the [[United States Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]]. He provided an explanation for the "[[Khourah]]" operation, a drug protection program, in a [[United States Government|U.S. government]] submission dated March 20, 1991. Caffrey stated that the operation was a "controlled delivery," a technique where a law enforcement agency permits and monitors shipments of contraband, including drugs, to move from a source or transit location to its intended destination. This method is used to identify and arrest high-ranking members of trafficking organizations rather than just low-level couriers.[^1]
