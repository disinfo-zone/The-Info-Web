[[Idi Amin]] was the self-proclaimed president of [[Uganda]]. He was installed in a military coup planned and led by former [[Israel|Israeli]] military attach√© Col. Baruch Bar Lev. Relations between [[Israel]] and [[Idi Amin|Amin]] were at their lowest at the time of the 1976 [[Entebbe hijacking]].[^1]

Relations between [[Israel]] and [[Uganda]] deteriorated after [[Muammar Qaddafi|Col. Muammar Qaddafi]] of [[Libya]] promised money to black [[Africa|African]] nations if they cut ties with [[Israel]]. Despite this, [[Idi Amin|Amin]] still wore the paratrooper's wings bestowed on him by the [[Israel|Israeli]] military during his training in [[Israel]].[^1]
