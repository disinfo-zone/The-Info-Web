[[Gunther Karl Russbacher]] was a client of attorney [[Paul Wilcher]]. Wilcher believed Russbacher to be a political prisoner, persecuted because he allegedly flew former President [[George Bush]] to [[Paris]] to meet with leading Iranians to make a deal to supply [[Iran]] with weapons in exchange for that government keeping the 52 American hostages until after the November election, ensuring [[Ronald Reagan]]'s victory. The deal was that the hostages would be delivered to [[Ronald Reagan]] as soon as Reagan was inaugurated in 1981. This came to be known as the [[October Surprise]].[^1]

Wilcher was working daily for Russbacher and wanted to ask [[Janet Reno]], the new [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], to grant immunity from prosecution to Russbacher so that he might testify to the [[United States Government|government]] about activities inside the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].[^1]
