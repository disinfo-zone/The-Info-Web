Chief [[Gatsha Buthelezi]] was a figure in [[South Africa]] who led "black death squads" that were involved in violence against black revolutionary groups, including the [[African National Congress]]. This was part of an operation facilitated by the [[PROMIS]] software, which tracked dissidents and generated death lists. The term "Kushi kills Kushi" was used in [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence circles to describe these actions.[^1]
