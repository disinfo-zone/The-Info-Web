Milbourne Christopher was a renowned American stage magician and author. He was known for his expertise in exposing fraudulent psychic claims and was occasionally brought into the [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) laboratory during experiments with [[Uri Geller]].[^1]

[[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]], wary of Geller's showman tendencies and potential use of sleight of hand, would sometimes disguise Christopher as a camera-wielding lab technician to observe Geller's performances. This was part of their effort to ensure the scientific rigor of their experiments and to guard against any trickery.[^1]
