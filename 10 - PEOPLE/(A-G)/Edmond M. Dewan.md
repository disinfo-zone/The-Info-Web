Edmond M. Dewan was a physicist at the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories]] in Bedford, [[Massachusetts]]. In the early 1960s, he pioneered the work on [[Synthetic Telepathy]], a technology that allows the brain to receive a message that it perceives to be a voice transmission, but is actually a microwave beam[^1].

Motivated by a desire to gain philosophical insight into the nature of [[Consciousness]], Dewan trained himself and members of his research staff to modulate the brain's alpha rhythms. They practiced until they could control their own brain waves at will, and filmed the results of their experiments. After advanced training, Dewan was able to imagine individual letters of the alphabet in Morse code and then send these coded signals to machinery[^1].

Dewan's first Morse code message, "I can talk," took twenty-five seconds per letter to transmit and record. The authentication of this seminal laboratory experiment in 1964 led to a *Washington Post* article titled, "Man’s Brain Waves Can ‘Talk’ Overcoming Speech Barriers"[^1].

His work laid the foundation for modern [[Brain-Computer Interface]] technology, which aims to enable soldiers to communicate by thought alone[^1].
