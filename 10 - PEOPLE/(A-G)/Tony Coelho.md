[[Tony Coelho]] was a Congressman whose district encompassed Mariposa and Yosemite National Park. He was closely associated with [[Ed Hardy]], president of Curry Company, Mariposa District Attorney [[Bruce Eckerson]], and County Assessor [[Steve Dunbar]]. These men were known for their annual camping trips together. Coelho and Hardy were regular fixtures around town, seen at most social events, and Coelho even cooked and served spaghetti dinners for the whole town annually at the Mariposa Fair Grounds.[^1]

Coelho purchased property in partnership with one member of the Mariposa Board of Supervisors. Mariposa was one of the first places Coelho bid farewell to after resigning from Congress to avoid an investigation of his finances.[^1]
