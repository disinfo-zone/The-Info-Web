[[James White]] was an Assistant [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] in Fresno. He ordered [[Dr. Arthur Dahlem]]'s files seized to prove [[Roderick Sinclair]]'s alleged drug use in connection with the "[[Queen's accident]]." However, [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]] Judge [[Robert E. Coyle]] ordered White to "drop the criminal investigation," stating Sinclair's drug problem was not relevant and drug records could not be used in court.[^1]

White revealed that the original [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] report on the "[[Queen's accident]]" was sent to the State Attorney General's office ([[John Van de Kamp]]), who told his assistant to "discard" it. [[Bruce Eckerson]], the Mariposa County District Attorney, was then appointed to take charge of the investigation and submit a new report. White noted that all of the "crack M.A.I.T.S. team" [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] officers involved in the original investigation either resigned or were transferred or fired. The [[California Highway Patrol|CHP]] Commander and Deputy Commander who supervised the M.A.I.T.S. investigation also resigned, as did White himself after the cover-up.[^1]

Before his resignation, White quietly filed the transcripts of the trial and an affidavit listing the "hallucinatory" drugs Sinclair had used prior to the accident with [[Stephan LaPalm]] of the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]'s office in Sacramento.[^1]
