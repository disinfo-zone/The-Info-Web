I. M. Kogan was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] electrical engineer and parapsychologist who approached psi research from a communications perspective. Unlike some other Soviet researchers, his work was considered relatively serious by Western intelligence agencies.[^1]

Kogan, like many [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] researchers, hypothesized that psi was a low-frequency radio system built into human brains. He conducted experiments to characterize psi data transmission, concluding that it could transmit about 0.1 "bit" of information per second within a laboratory, decreasing to 0.005 bits per second over six hundred miles.[^1]

His work gained further attention when it suddenly disappeared from public view around 1969, coinciding with reports that the [[Soviet Union|KGB]] had begun to fund and direct his laboratory at the Popov Society. This suggested a heightened interest from Soviet intelligence in the practical applications of psi.[^1]
