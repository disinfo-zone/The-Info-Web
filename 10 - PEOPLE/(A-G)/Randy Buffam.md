[[Randy Buffam]] was a partner of [[Sean McDade]] in the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]]'s national security section. He was a Middle Eastern Terrorist Specialist in the [[Canada|Canadian]] intelligence services. Buffam, along with McDade, covertly entered the [[United States]] for nearly eight months to conduct a secret investigation into the alleged theft of [[PROMIS]] software and its role in suspected security breaches.[^1]

Buffam was present during McDade's initial meeting with [[Cheri Seymour]] and [[Sue Todd]]. He assisted McDade in copying thousands of documents from [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s hidden files. Buffam also accompanied McDade and Todd to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] headquarters in [[Los Angeles]] and to interview [[Gene Gilbert]] at the Riverside D.A.'s office.[^1]

Buffam acknowledged that the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] had requested information on [[Robert Booth Nichols]] and received a significant report from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He noted that Nichols was suspected of money laundering in connection with the Royal Bank of [[Canada]], which had originally funded Hercules Corporation. Buffam also discussed the role of CSEC (Communications Security Establishment) in [[Canada]], which he said is used by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to spy on American communications, with the [[United States Government|U.S. government]] reciprocating by spying on [[Canada|Canadian]] communications.[^1]

After the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] probe was closed, Buffam mailed the Riconosciuto/PROMIS tapes back to the Hercules Police Department, according to [[Sue Todd]].[^1]
