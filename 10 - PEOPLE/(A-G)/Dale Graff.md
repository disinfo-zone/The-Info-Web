[[Dale Graff]] is a [[U.S. Air Force]] civilian scientist who played a significant role in the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]]. He worked in the Foreign Technology Division at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] in Ohio, where he was responsible for keeping the Air Force and [[Department of Defense|DoD]] planners aware of cutting-edge military research in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[China]].[^1]

Graff's interest in [[Psi|psi]] phenomena stemmed from a personal experience in 1968, where he had a profound [[Out-of-Body Experience|out-of-body experience]] while caught in a rip current. This led him to research anomalous mental phenomena, and he later sought to integrate psychic abilities into military applications.[^1]

He authored the 1977 report "[[Paraphysics R&D - Warsaw Pact]]," which highlighted Soviet research in electromagnetic fields, quantum physics, and [[Psychokinesis]]. This report, along with his advocacy, contributed to the DoD's decision to officially fund a psychic research program.[^1]

Graff was instrumental in the establishment and management of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program. He collaborated with [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] of [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] and oversaw the remote viewing unit at [[Fort Meade]]. He was involved in numerous operational taskings, including the successful remote viewing of a new Chinese nuclear device and the location of a lost Soviet bomber in Zaire.[^1]

Graff later became the overall manager of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]] under the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]], where he sought to develop a general theory for psychic phenomena. He also played a role in the program's involvement in the Iran hostage crisis and the search for General Dozier.[^1]
