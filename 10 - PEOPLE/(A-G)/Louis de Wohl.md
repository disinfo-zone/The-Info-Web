Louis de Wohl was a Hungarian-born British astrologer who was used by [[British Intelligence]] as a key figure in a black propaganda campaign during World War II. His syndicated American column, "Stars Foretell," was used to spread disinformation and influence public opinion in favor of Britain.[^1]

De Wohl's predictions, which often came true due to his access to inside information from British intelligence, convinced many of his supposed supernatural powers. His work was part of a larger effort to counter the Nazi's use of astrology and the occult, and to sway American public opinion towards joining the war.[^1]
