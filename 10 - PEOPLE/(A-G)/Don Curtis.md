[[Don Curtis]] was a physicist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. He was part of the group that investigated [[Uri Geller]]'s psychokinetic abilities. After the group ceased its research activities with Geller, Curtis and his wife experienced one of the last bizarre apparitions: a hovering, holographic, one-armed man in a gray suit with a hook for a hand. This unsettling experience prompted [[Richard Kennett]] to demand a meeting with [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] to understand the phenomena.[^1]
