Eileen Garrett was an Irish medium who was well-known in New York City parapsychology circles. She was one of the psychics tested by [[Andrija Puharich]] at his [[Round Table Foundation]] in Maine.[^1]

Garrett's psychic abilities were tested in a [[Faraday cage]] using Zener cards. According to Puharich, her ESP scores were significantly higher inside the cage, which suggested that electronic shielding had a positive impact on psychic functioning.[^1]
