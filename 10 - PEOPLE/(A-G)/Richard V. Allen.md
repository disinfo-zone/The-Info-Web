Richard V. Allen was the National Security Advisor to President [[Ronald Reagan]]. He was informed of the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak]] in June 1981. Allen immediately telephoned Reagan, who privately expressed delight at the attack. Allen was present at a meeting of Reagan's high command where [[Caspar Weinberger]] proposed canceling F-16 aircraft sales to [[Israel]], but Reagan had no intention of taking such a step.[^1]

Allen personally relayed the message to [[Ariel Sharon]] in the fall of 1981 that the [[United States]] would no longer permit [[Israel]] to get [[KH-11]] imagery of the [[Soviet Union]] or any other country outside the hundred-mile limit, re-enforcing the initial 1979 restrictions. Allen was not intimidated by Sharon's bellowing about American aid being "Band-Aids and mustard plaster."[^1]
