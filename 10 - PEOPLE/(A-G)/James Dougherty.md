James Dougherty was a Florida lawyer for [[Lloyd's of London]] who investigated [[Munther Ismael Bilheisi]] and the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^1] He was known for his zealous pursuit of cases and his comprehensive database on BCCI activities.

### Investigations and Discoveries

Dougherty's investigation into Bilheisi's business activities began after Bilheisi made false claims against Lloyd's of London.[^2] He uncovered Bilheisi's formidable smuggling operation, which was facilitated by BCCI through financing and falsified documents.[^3] Dougherty also discovered BCCI's involvement in illegal arms deals, including a helicopter deal in Guatemala.[^4]

He made repeated attempts to engage U.S. law enforcement agencies, including the Justice Department, in investigating BCCI's broader criminal activities, but faced resistance and lack of cooperation.[^5] Dougherty's efforts were instrumental in bringing to light the extent of BCCI's illicit operations and its connections to various individuals and entities.

### Legal Proceedings

Dougherty's work led to the indictment of Munther Bilheisi for tax evasion and corruption in Guatemala.[^6] He also provided information to journalists [[Jonathan Beaty]] and [[S. C. Gwynne]], contributing to their investigative reporting on the BCCI scandal.[^7]
