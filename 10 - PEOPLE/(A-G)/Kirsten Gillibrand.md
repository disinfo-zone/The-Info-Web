[[Kirsten Gillibrand]] is a United States Senator from New York who has been a leading voice in the recent legislative efforts to increase transparency and oversight of the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) issue. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, she has worked to destigmatize the topic and to ensure that the U.S. government takes the potential national security threat posed by UAP seriously.[^1]

### Support for UAP Legislation

Senator Gillibrand has been a key ally in the bipartisan effort to pass UAP-related legislation. She has worked closely with Senators [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Chuck Schumer]], as well as with [[Christopher Mellon]] and [[Luis Elizondo]], to draft and pass language in the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs) that has mandated the creation of a permanent UAP office ([[All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office|AARO]]) and established a secure process for whistleblowers to report UAP-related information to Congress.[^1]

She has been a vocal advocate for the importance of understanding the UAP issue, stating that "Understanding UAP is critical to our national security and to maintaining all-domain awareness. Declassifying previous records related to UAP is part of that mission and Iâ€™m proud to support this important amendment." Her support has been crucial in building the bipartisan consensus that has been necessary to move the UAP disclosure effort forward.[^1]
