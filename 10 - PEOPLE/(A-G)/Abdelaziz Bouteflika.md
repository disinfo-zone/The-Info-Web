[[Abdelaziz Bouteflika]] was an [[Algeria|Algerian]] Foreign Minister and a well-respected diplomat. He met with various [[Iran|Iranian]] leaders, including [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]], in April 1980 to discuss the [[USA|American]] hostage crisis. However, he failed to broker an accord because he was unable to guarantee arms sales to [[Iran]].[^1]
