[[Michael DeFeo]] was the deputy to [[David Margolis]], chief of the Organized Crime Strike Force at the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]. He, along with Margolis, reportedly called [[Marvin Rudnick]], a Los Angeles prosecutor, to Washington D.C. and instructed him to eliminate [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] from his investigation into [[Sal Pisello]].[^1]

[[William Hundley]], retained by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], confirmed meeting with Margolis and DeFeo to convey [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]'s willingness to cooperate in any organized crime investigation. [[Marvin Rudnick]] accused DeFeo of having an agenda to obstruct justice in the [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] investigation. [[Richard Stavin]] confirmed that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] wiretap revealed a conversation in which [[Eugene Giaquinto]] told [[Martin Bacow]] that he would call [[Edwin Meese]] and have the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]'s investigation of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] stopped. This investigation was indeed shut down afterward by the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]].[^1]

DeFeo reportedly threatened [[Richard Stavin]] about talking about the circumstances of the case, or "throwing dirt," when Stavin quit the Organized Crime Strike Force in May 1989.[^1]
