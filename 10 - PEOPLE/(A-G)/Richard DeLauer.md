Richard DeLauer was the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. He was an alumnus of [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], the same institution where [[H. S. Tsien]] had studied and co-founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory[^1].

DeLauer was aware of the power and influence wielded by Tsien, whom he called the "elder statesman" of Chinese scientific technology and development. After receiving [[Hal Puthoff]]'s sixty-page classified report, "Psychoenergetics Research in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China (1982)," and a back-up briefing, DeLauer signed a memo allocating additional resources, Program Six funds, for the psychic research program [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] (later renamed [[STARGATE PROJECT|Star Gate]])[^1].
