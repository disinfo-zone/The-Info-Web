William Colby (1920â€“1996) was an American intelligence officer who served as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from 1973 to 1976. He was at the helm of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] during a period of significant scrutiny and controversy, including revelations about [[Project MKUltra]][^1].

In the context of the [[Moscow Signal]], Colby wrote to the U.S. ambassador, informing him that "The increased probability of health injuries to personnel at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow [redacted] warrant our immediate attention." This communication came after the [[Soviet Union]] installed a second microwave transmitter aimed at the embassy, indicating the signal was becoming more potent[^1].

Colby's tenure was marked by his efforts to be more transparent with Congress and the public about past CIA activities, which led to the declassification of some documents related to controversial programs[^1].
