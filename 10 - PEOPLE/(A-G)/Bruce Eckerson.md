[[Bruce Eckerson]] was the Mariposa County District Attorney. He was closely associated with [[Ed Hardy]], president of Curry Company, and County Assessor [[Steve Dunbar]], and Congressman [[Tony Coelho]]. These men were known for their annual camping trips together.[^1]

Eckerson's disclosure statements on file at the Mariposa County Courthouse indicated that he owned stock in [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] Entertainment Corporation. He was appointed by [[John Van de Kamp]], the State Attorney General, to take charge of the investigation into the "[[Queen's accident]]" and submit a new report, after Van de Kamp allegedly told his assistant to "discard" the original report.[^1]
