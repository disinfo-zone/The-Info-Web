[[David Grusch]] is a former intelligence officer from the [[National Reconnaissance Office]] (NRO) and the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) who served as the NRO's representative on the [[UAP Task Force]]. He is a key whistleblower who has provided Congress and the Intelligence Community Inspector General with extensive classified information about deeply covert programs that he says have retrieved intact and partially intact craft of non-human origin.[^1]

### Whistleblower Testimony

In 2023, Grusch went public with his allegations, testifying under oath before the House Oversight Committee's National Security Subcommittee. He stated that he was informed of a multi-decade UAP crash retrieval and reverse-engineering program during the course of his official duties. He claimed that the U.S. government is in possession of non-human technology and "biologics" from the occupants of these craft.[^1]

Grusch's testimony was a watershed moment in the UAP disclosure movement. As a high-ranking intelligence officer with an impeccable record, his claims have been taken very seriously by Congress and have led to a new level of scrutiny on the so-called "Legacy Program." He has provided hours of classified testimony to congressional committees and the Inspector General, and his allegations have been a major driver of the recent UAP disclosure legislation.[^1]

### Retaliation and Impact

Since coming forward, Grusch has faced a campaign of retaliation and character assassination, which he has reported to the Inspector General. Despite this, his testimony has had a profound impact on the UAP conversation, emboldening other whistleblowers to come forward and forcing the U.S. government to confront the issue of UAP secrecy in a way that it never has before.[^1]
