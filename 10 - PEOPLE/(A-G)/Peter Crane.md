Peter Crane was a physicist at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL). In late 1974, concerned about the potential security threat posed by psychic abilities, Crane, along with security officer [[Ron Robertson]] and others, began conducting their own experiments with [[Uri Geller]] outside of work hours.[^1]

Crane and his group tested Geller's psychokinetic abilities, including metal-bending and attempts to deflect laser beams. While their tests concluded that Geller's abilities were not effective over long distances, Crane was one of the Livermore personnel who experienced a series of bizarre, hallucination-inducing phenomena after their involvement with Geller. These included visions of hovering, monochrome flying saucers and strange animals.[^1]

Overwhelmed by these experiences, Crane contacted [[Richard Kennett]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] for help. Kennett investigated the situation, which included a strange metallic voice on an audiotape that pronounced the code name of a highly classified government project unknown to Crane or his colleagues. The apparitions eventually ceased after the Livermore group stopped their research activities with Geller.[^1]
