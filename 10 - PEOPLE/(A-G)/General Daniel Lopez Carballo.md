[[General Daniel Lopez Carballo]] was a retired Honduran General and a member of FGBMFI ([[Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International]]). He was a keynote speaker at a FGBMFI dinner event in Fresno, [[California]], in February 2008, alongside [[Jimmy Hughes]].[^1]

Lopez Carballo was identified in a Spanish publication, *Publico.es*, as the "designer of the military strategy of the coup d'etat" that ousted President [[Manuel Zelaya]] in [[Honduras]] on June 28, 2009. He, along with [[Romeo Vásquez Velásquez]], placed [[Roberto Micheletti]] in office as Zelaya's successor. Lopez Carballo justified the coup by stating that [[Venezuelan President]] [[Hugo Chávez]] would eventually be running [[Honduras]] by proxy if the military had not acted.[^1]

Lopez Carballo had been trained at the [[School of the Americas]] (SOA/WHINSEC), attending at least twice, in 1976 and 1984. He was also mentioned as a friend of [[Jimmy Hughes]], who ministers to the military and trains military personnel in [[Honduras]].[^1]
