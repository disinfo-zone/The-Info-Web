Norm Everheart was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] technical operations specialist with nearly a quarter-century of service by the mid-1970s. He had a background as a clandestine radio operator and had worked in the Agency's Office of Communications and Technical Services Division (OTS).[^1]

In late 1974 or early 1975, Everheart was appointed liaison to "Staff D," an office specializing in small-scale signals intelligence collection. It was in this role that he was introduced to the remote viewing program by [[Ken Kress]], who had initiated SRI's first psi research contract. Everheart, initially unfamiliar with remote viewing, was urged to consider how it might benefit Staff D operations, particularly through the abilities of [[Pat Price]].[^1]

Everheart became a chief coordinator for [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] taskings from the CIA's Operations Directorate. He was a pragmatic and relatively open-minded individual in the often "cold and conniving" world of intelligence. He often employed an "oblique targeting method," where the remote viewer was given minimal information about the target, which helped to build confidence in the accuracy of the psychic data when it matched the unknown facts.[^1]

He was involved in several notable remote viewing operations, including the tracking of a Soviet diplomat using a fishing pole for dead-drop operations, and the interrogation of a KGB agent in South Africa by [[Ken Bell]] using telepathic techniques. Everheart was a strong proponent of remote viewing, despite facing skepticism and the "giggle factor" from some within the Agency, such as Staff D chief Ed Rogers.[^1]
