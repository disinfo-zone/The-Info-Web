Robert Gates is an American government official who served as the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from 1991 to 1993. He was also an analyst on loan to the [[National Security Council|NSC]] from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] during the [[Cold War]][^1][^2].

Gates was known to be a vocal adversary of the [[Psychoenergetics|psychoenergetic phenomena]] programs within the [[Pentagon]]. He expressed skepticism about the [[Remote Viewing]] program, particularly after [[Joe McMoneagle]]'s remote viewing of the [[Typhoon Submarine|Typhoon]] class submarine, which Gates initially dismissed as defying logic[^2].

In 1986, Gates noted a significant buildup in advanced technology weapons facilities in both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], particularly in areas like laser, particle beam, kinetic energy, and microwave technologies applicable to strategic weapons[^2].

Gates revealed details about the [[Moscow Signal]] in his 1997 memoir, *From the Shadows*. He described how the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] detected a new and more powerful set of Soviet microwave beams aimed at the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] in 1973, code-named MUTS-2. He noted that these signals were regarded as posing a greater health hazard due to their duration and peculiar characteristics[^2].

On November 28, 1995, Gates appeared on *Nightline* with [[Ted Koppel]] to discuss the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate program]], where he downplayed the significance of the government's psychic research[^2].
