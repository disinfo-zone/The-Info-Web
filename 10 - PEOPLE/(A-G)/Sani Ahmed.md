Sani Ahmed was a key figure in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], serving as the head of its protocol department in [[Pakistan]] before moving to [[Washington, D.C.]] to run BCCI's representative office.[^1] He was a confidant of [[Agha Hasan Abedi]], the founder of BCCI, and played a significant role in the bank's operations, particularly in cultivating relationships with wealthy clients and government officials.

### Role in BCCI's Protocol Department

Abedi established the protocol department in 1975 to cater to the needs of wealthy clients visiting Pakistan.[^2] By 1978, the department had grown to over one hundred staff members and operated with a budget of $1.5 million, exceeding the bank itself in size.[^3] Ahmed was responsible for managing the Pakistan palaces and homes of royal families, hiring staff, and acting as a tour guide for major depositors.[^4] The department maintained a fleet of over one hundred limousines for the use of important guests.[^5]

Beyond these services, Ahmed's protocol department was also involved in less conventional activities, including arranging entertainment for Middle Eastern businessmen and sheikhs, which sometimes involved procuring young women.[^6] This practice was highly successful in attracting and retaining clients, with the bank spending up to $100,000 on such evenings.[^7] By 1988, the department had expanded to nearly five hundred employees, offering a range of exotic benefits.[^8]

According to [[Sami Masri]], protocol officers under Ahmed were responsible for moving money for illicit operations and for luring businessmen, military officers, and politicians into Abedi's network.[^9] Ahmed worked with Abedi at [[United Bank]] before BCCI, despite having little technical banking knowledge.[^10]

### Connections and Influence

Ahmed's role extended to maintaining Pakistan's official diplomatic relations with [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] emirates, and expanding Pakistan's ties with [[China]].[^11] He was involved in communications with [[Robert Altman]] regarding BCCI matters.[^12]
