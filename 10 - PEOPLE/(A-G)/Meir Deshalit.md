Meir Deshalit, also known as Meme Deshalit, was an Israeli intelligence official and a close colleague of [[James Jesus Angleton]]. He had been posted to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1948. Deshalit was the older brother of [[Amos Deshalit]], the physicist who contributed significantly to [[Israel]]'s nuclear arsenal before his death in 1969. Angleton shared Meir Deshalit's view of the Soviet and Arab threat to [[Israel]], making him a logical choice to handle liaison between the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the Israeli government.[^1]
