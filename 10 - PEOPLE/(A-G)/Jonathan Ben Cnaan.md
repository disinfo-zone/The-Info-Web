Jonathan Ben Cnaan was an account executive with [[53rd Street Ventures]], a New York City venture capital firm that held a small equity investment in [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]. [[Bill Hamilton]]'s affidavit claimed that in September 1983, Ben Cnaan described a meeting at 53rd Street Ventures with a "businessman with ties at the highest level of the Reagan Administration" who was eager to obtain the [[PROMIS]] software for federal government contract work. This businessman allegedly assured 53rd Street Ventures that Inslaw would never be able to resolve its contract disputes with the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] and was annoyed that Hamilton had previously rebuffed an attempt to buy Inslaw to obtain title to the PROMIS software. [[Earl Brian]] denied knowing Ben Cnaan and insisted he was not the unidentified businessman mentioned in Hamilton's affidavit.[^1]

The Special Counsel's investigation attempted to locate Jonathan Ben Cnaan, but his phone number was disconnected, and his last known company, [[Axiom Capital]], was no longer at its listed address. It was believed he might have returned to [[Israel]]. The investigation concluded that even if the attribution to Ben Cnaan were correct, there was nothing to tie the claim to [[Hadron]] or Brian, as Brian denied it and Ben Cnaan himself did not refer to Brian in the affidavit. The report found no other evidence to support [[INSLAW|Inslaw]]'s allegation regarding a Brian-DOJ conspiracy.[^1]
