[[Fred Alvarez]] was the former vice-chairman of the [[Cabazon Tribal Council]]. He was a victim of an execution-style triple homicide on June 29, 1981, in Rancho Mirage, [[California]], along with his friends [[Ralph Boger]] and [[Patricia Castro]]. His murder occurred just six months before the murder of [[Paul Morasca]].[^1]

Alvarez had been chosen to manage the [[Cabazon Casino]] shortly before his murder. Reports related to the Alvarez triple-homicide, including those concerning "[[The Octopus]]", were later found in the "Paul Morasca Homicide Investigation File" in San Francisco, as the original Riverside files were missing.[^1]
