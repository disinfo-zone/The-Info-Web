### Connections to "The Octopus" Investigation

Abbell's activities became a significant focus of investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]]'s "[[The Octopus]]" probe during the last week of Casolaro's life. Casolaro had discovered a connection between Abbell, the [[Cali Drug Cartel]], and [[Robert Booth Nichols]], an international intelligence operative.[1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that Abbell, [[Robert Booth Nichols]], and [[Gilberto Rodriguez]] were "all in bed together." Riconosciuto also alleged that Nichols provided Abbell with $50,000 in cash to handle an internal affairs investigation within the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] that would have led to the extradition of Cali Cartel leaders [[Gilberto Rodriguez]] and [[Jose Londono]], whom Nichols reportedly considered "intelligence people."[1]
