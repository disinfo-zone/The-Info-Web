Jack Anderson (1922â€“2005) was a Pulitzer Prize-winning American investigative journalist and syndicated columnist for *The Washington Post*. He was known for his muckraking style and his ability to uncover classified government information[^1].

Anderson brought Lieutenant Colonel [[John B. Alexander]]'s article, "The New Mental Battlefield: Beam Me Up, Spock," to national attention by writing about it in his column under the heading "Voodoo Warriors of the Pentagon." In his column, Anderson surmised that the generals at the [[Pentagon]] were "dabbling in the dark arts," using Ouija boards and the evil eye, and studying programs "a Haitian witch doctor might try." The wire services picked up the story, and it went national, causing a stir within the military establishment[^1].
