Norm Everheart was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] technical operations specialist who served as the chief coordinator for [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] taskings from the CIA's Operations Directorate. In 1950, at the age of twenty, he was recruited by the fledgling intelligence agency as a television engineer, and was sent to Greece as a clandestine radio operator. Later, he worked for the Agency's Office of Communications and then the Technical Services Division (TSD), which later became the Office of Technical Service (OTS). His last posting before becoming a coordinator for Grill Flame was as the chief of OTS's regional "tech base" in Athens.[^1]

Everheart was appointed liaison to "Staff D" (later the Office of SIGINT Operations), an office specializing in small-scale signals-intelligence collection. He was introduced to the remote viewing program by [[Ken Kress]], an OTS engineer who had given [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) its first psi research contract. Everheart, initially unfamiliar with remote viewing, was urged by Kress to consider how Staff D operations might benefit from remote viewers, particularly [[Pat Price]].[^1]

Everheart became a strong proponent of remote viewing within the CIA, having been involved in psychic spying experiments since the early days of the CIA-sponsored work at SRI. He and his superior, [[John McMahon]], the CIA's deputy director for operations, were willing to give remote viewing a try in operational situations. He was known for his "oblique targeting method," where he would not reveal the specific information desired, allowing the remote viewers to provide it independently, which helped build confidence in their results.[^1]

One of his notable successes involved a KGB "illegal" in South Africa. Everheart tasked [[Ken Bell]] and [[Mel Riley]] to remote-view the agent, leading to the discovery of a hidden pocket calculator used for coding messages. He also tasked [[Joe McMoneagle]] to remote-view a Soviet Embassy official with a fishing pole, which led to the discovery of a dead-drop site. Despite the "giggle factor" from skeptical colleagues like Staff D chief [[Ed Rogers]], Everheart continued to advocate for and utilize remote viewing in intelligence operations.[^1]
