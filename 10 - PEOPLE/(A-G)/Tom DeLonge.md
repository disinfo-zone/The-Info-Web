[[Tom DeLonge]] is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, record producer, actor, and filmmaker. He is the co-founder, co-lead vocalist, and guitarist of the rock band Blink-182. He is also the founder of [[To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science]] (TTSA), an organization dedicated to the investigation of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) and other fringe scientific topics.[^1]

### Interest in UAP and Founding of TTSA

DeLonge has had a lifelong interest in UAP and has used his celebrity to bring attention to the issue. In 2017, he founded [[To The Stars Academy of Arts & Science]] with the goal of creating a platform for serious scientific research into UAP and educating the public about the phenomenon. He assembled a team of former high-ranking government officials and scientists, including [[Luis Elizondo]], [[Christopher Mellon]], [[Jim Semivan]], and [[Hal Puthoff]], to lead the organization.[^1]

TTSA was instrumental in the public release of the three declassified UAP videos—"FLIR" (Tic Tac), "GIMBAL," and "GoFast"—and produced the television show "Unidentified: Inside America's UFO Investigation" on the History Channel. While the organization was not a long-term financial success, it played a crucial role in raising the public profile of the UAP issue and helping to break the long-standing stigma surrounding the topic.[^1]
