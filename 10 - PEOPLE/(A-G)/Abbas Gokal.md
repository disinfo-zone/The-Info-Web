Abbas Gokal was one of the [[Gokal brothers]] who ran the [[Gulf Group]], a London-based shipping company.[^1]

### Role in BCCI Operations

Abbas Gokal was used as a front by [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] in 1975 in an attempt to acquire Chelsea National Bank in [[New York]].[^2] Regulators rejected this bid due to concerns about BCCI's involvement.[^2]

The Gulf Group, run by the Gokal brothers, was believed to be BCCI's largest debtor, with loans topping out at $831 million in 1990 that were never repaid.[^3] The Gokal brothers' shipping empire was built with BCCI money.[^3]
