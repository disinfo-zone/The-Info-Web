[[Nachum Admoni]] was the acting Director of [[Mossad]] and later its full Director. He was the first [[Mossad]] chief to be appointed from the bureaucracy rather than the military. He was appointed after [[Yekutiel Adam]], who was in line for the position, was assassinated.[^1]

[[Nachum Admoni|Admoni]] was involved in the [[Iran-Israel Joint Committee]], which was assigned the task of supplying [[Iran]] with arms in its war with [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Hussein's]] [[Iraq]]. He had equal power with the Director of [[Israeli Military Intelligence]] on the subject of arms to [[Iran]].[^1]

[[Nachum Admoni|Admoni]] was briefed by [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] on the [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence network's arms sales to [[Iran]] for [[George Bush|Vice President George Bush]] in July 1986. He also received a phone call from [[Robert Gates]] in early February 1989, expressing [[USA|U.S.]] unhappiness about [[Israel|Israeli]] activities in [[Chile]].[^1]

[[Nachum Admoni|Admoni]] was involved in the decision to move [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] money, which was under [[Israel|Israeli]] control, to the [[East Bloc]] in 1989. He was one of the three signatories to the slush-fund accounts, along with [[Ari Ben-Menashe]].[^1]

[[Nachum Admoni|Admoni]] left [[Mossad]] in 1989, but continued to advise [[Yitzhak Shamir]] on intelligence matters. He later became the chair of a public utility in [[Israel]].[^1]
