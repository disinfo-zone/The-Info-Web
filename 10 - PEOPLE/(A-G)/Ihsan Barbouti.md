[[Ihsan Barbouti]] was an Egyptian national living in the [[USA|U.S.]]. He was involved in the procurement of materials for chemical weapons and had connections to various intelligence operations.

Barbouti procured artillery cups for [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen's]] [[Santiago]]-produced chemical weapons from [[West Germany]]. He had previously provided equipment for chemical weapons to [[Libya]] and was known for arranging for former [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] scientists to work on missile technology in [[Egypt]] in the 1950s. He faked his death to escape [[Mossad]] and resurfaced in the [[USA|U.S.]] in the early 1980s. According to [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence, he later cut a deal with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and began working on its behalf with [[Arab countries]], basing himself in [[Texas]] and [[Florida]].[^1]

He had an interest in [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen's]] "agricultural project" (chemical plant) in [[Paraguay]], which was a joint venture, sourcing materials from [[Florida]] and [[Texas]]. Barbouti was also involved in nuclear missile projects in [[Iraq]] through the [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen]] network. He was named as an enemy of the state by an [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence committee and was placed on an execution list, though [[Yitzhak Shamir]] intervened to put the executions on hold.[^1]
