[[Chris Cannon]] was the San Francisco defense attorney for [[Ben Kalka]]. He explained that the chemical precursors necessary to make the amount of methamphetamine Kalka produced would require all the precursor sold in one year in the [[United States]] on the open market. Cannon struck a deal that resulted in Kalka's sentence being overturned, contingent upon Kalka signing a letter stating he did not obtain his precursors from the [[United States Government|U.S. government]].[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] told Cannon that he had records proving the precursors Kalka used were provided by the [[United States Government|U.S. government]]. Riconosciuto also described the role of federal agents and their authorization for him to sell Kalka the final ingredient needed to make methamphetamine.[^1]
