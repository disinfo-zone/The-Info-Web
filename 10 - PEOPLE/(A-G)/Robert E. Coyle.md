[[Robert E. Coyle]] was a [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]] Judge. In the federal probe concerning the "[[Queen's accident]]," he ordered Assistant [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[James White]] to "drop the criminal investigation" into [[Roderick Sinclair]]'s alleged drug use. Judge Coyle stated that Sinclair's drug problem was not relevant to the prosecution and that drug records could not be used in court because no blood tests had been taken on Sinclair at the Fremont Hospital on the day of the accident. However, the text notes that blood tests had been taken but later disappeared.[^1]

In the civil trial that followed the "Queen's accident," Judge Coyle ruled that both [[Roderick Sinclair]] and the deceased Secret Service agents were at fault. Mariposa County was ordered to pay 70 percent of the claim filed by the widows, and the Secret Service to pay 30 percent.[^1]

Retired [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent [[Tom Walsh]] provided information alleging that Judge Coyle was once the attorney of record for [[Curry Company]] (owned by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]) in Yosemite National Park.[^1]
