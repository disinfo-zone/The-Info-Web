[[Mehdi Bazargan]] was the first prime minister appointed by the revolutionary government of [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]] in [[Iran]]. He was a member of the National Front and a supporter of [[Mohammed Mossadegh]], representing [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini's]] compromise between the fundamentalists and the middle class.[^1]

[[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] believed that both the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and the [[USA|U.S.]] were evil, but preferred the [[USA|U.S.]] to the "godless communists." He sought to normalize relations with [[Washington D.C.]] and allowed the [[USA|U.S.]] Embassy in [[Tehran]] to operate, continuing to deal with the [[USA|Americans]].[^1]

[[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan's]] faction was in a tense power struggle with extremist fundamentalist groups who opposed any relationship with the [[USA|U.S.]]. [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence, concerned about an imminent [[Iraq|Iraqi]] attack on [[Iran]], urged [[Jimmy Carter|President Carter]] to support [[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan's]] government, as he was willing to negotiate with the [[USA|Americans]] and accept help in reorganizing his military. However, the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration adopted a hands-off policy.[^1]

[[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] desperately needed [[USA|American]] arms and help against the [[Iraq|Iraqi]] threat. He resigned on November 4, 1979, after radical "students" took over the [[USA|U.S.]] Embassy and held staff hostage, a desperate attempt to draw attention to themselves due to the lack of [[USA|American]] aid.[^1]

[[Earl Brian]] and [[Robert McFarlane]] arranged a meeting with [[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] in late January 1980 in [[Tehran]] to discuss the hostage situation. [[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]] was still thought to be very close to [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] and [[Mehdi Karrubi|Hojjat El-Islam Mehdi Karrubi]].[^1]
