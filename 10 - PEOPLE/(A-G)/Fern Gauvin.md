Fernand "Fern" Gauvin was a civilian counterintelligence specialist working at Arlington Hall, a military/civilian intelligence complex. He was one of the original six soldier psychics selected for the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Gondola Wish]] program in 1977.[^1]

Gauvin, a dark-haired, handsome Rhode Islander in his late forties, had a long history of psychic experiences and transcendental yearnings dating back to his childhood. He practiced yoga and meditation, experimented with altered states, and read books about spirit-mediums and auras. In 1975, he had an unusual out-of-body experience, an encounter with a "benevolent, luminous, loving entity" that profoundly affected him.[^1]

Gauvin was one of the six most promising members of the team selected to travel to [[Stanford Research Institute]] (SRI) for further evaluation of their talents. He participated in the intense, round-the-clock remote viewing sessions during the Iran hostage crisis. Like [[Nancy Stern]], he was deeply affected by the failure of the rescue mission and subsequently left the unit, vowing never to remote-view again.[^1]
