Hans Bethe was a German-American theoretical physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967. He helped design the first American nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. Bethe recalled three visits to the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] where his hosts would "take me anywhere and discuss anything with me." However, they never offered to take him to [[Dimona]], which Bethe found significant, as he was interested in nuclear power reactors.[^1]
