Michael Edwards was one of two young magicians, along with [[Steven Shaw]], who participated in [[James Randi]]'s hoax against the McDonnell Laboratory for Psychical Research at Washington University in 1983. Edwards and Shaw pretended to be psychics capable of [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]], using sleight of hand to simulate feats like spoon bending[^1].

They spent a total of five weeks in the lab over a three-year period. The hoax was later exposed by Randi, generating significant negative press for the parapsychology community[^1].
