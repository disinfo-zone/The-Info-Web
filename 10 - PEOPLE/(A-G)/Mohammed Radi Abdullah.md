Colonel [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah]] was a former colonel in the [[Jordan|Jordanian]] Army. He was decorated by [[King Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]] of [[Jordan]] for his bravery in the [[1967 War|1967 Middle East war]]. His family later emigrated to [[London]] after falling out with the king over the mass slaughter of [[Palestinians]] by the [[Jordan|Jordanian]] Army in 1970.[^1]

[[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] became known as a businessman who championed [[Arab]] and [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] causes in [[Europe]]. To recoup gambling and other losses, he began working for [[Anthony Pearson]], who supplied intelligence information to [[Israel]]. Unwittingly, [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] helped [[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] acquire intelligence about Palestinian organizations in [[Europe]] by selling arms to them. This intelligence was then passed to [[Mossad]], leading to the elimination of 14 or 15 Palestinians over a two-month period.[^1]

[[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] was recruited by [[Rafi Eitan]] in 1978 to work for an antiterrorist group in [[Israel]], after [[Anthony Pearson|Pearson]] made it clear that the Â£200,000 loan he offered [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] came from an [[Israel|Israeli]] source.[^1]

[[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]] was a key player in [[Israel|Israeli]] "black" operations, including the 1986 plot to bomb an [[El Al]] plane, which was designed to discredit [[Syria]]. He instructed his cousin, [[Nezar Hindawi]], in this plot. He was also involved in the [[Achille Lauro]] attack in 1985, which was an [[Israel|Israeli]] "black" propaganda operation to portray Palestinians as ruthless terrorists. [[Rafi Eitan]] passed instructions to [[Mohammed Radi Abdullah|Radi]], who then relayed orders to [[Abul Abbas]] to carry out a cruel attack.[^1]
