Richard D'Amore is a partner in [[Hambro International Equity Partners]] ("Hambro"), a venture capital company based in Boston, Massachusetts, that invests in existing businesses. In 1983, Hambro invested approximately $400,000 in [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]], and D'Amore was placed on Inslaw's Board of Directors as Hambro was the lead investor.

[[Bill Hamilton]]'s affidavit attributed a statement to D'Amore, claiming that [[Patricia Cloherty]], [[Daniel Tessler]]'s wife and former business partner, had told D'Amore that she "knew all about" [[Earl Brian]]'s role in the [[PROMIS Software Scandal|Inslaw matter]]. However, D'Amore denied ever making such a statement to Hamilton or anyone else. He stated that he does not know of any role played by Brian, nor whether Cloherty knows of any such role. The Special Counsel's investigation found that D'Amore's denial, along with those of other individuals, contradicted Hamilton's claims and indicated no evidence of a conspiracy involving Brian or Hadron.[^1]
