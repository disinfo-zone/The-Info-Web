[[Yehuda Ben-Hanan]] was the owner of Software and Engineering Consultants, a small computer company based in Chatsworth, [[California]]. He was a childhood friend of [[Ari Ben-Menashe]].

[[Rafi Eitan]] selected Ben-Hanan to develop a "trap door" for the [[PROMIS]] software, which would allow external access to the computers of intelligence agencies using the program. Ben-Hanan was given blueprints and set about his work for a $5,000 fee, unaware of the true purpose of the project.[^1]
