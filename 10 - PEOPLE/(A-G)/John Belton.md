[[John Belton]] was a Canadian banker who claimed he lost a great deal of money regarding the sale of [[PROMIS]] to [[Canada]]. He alleged that his bank financed the purchase of [[PROMIS]] from [[Earl Brian]]. Through Belton, who was a mutually shared Canadian source, [[Sean McDade]] and [[Sue Todd]] were brought together and ultimately joined forces in their respective investigations.[^1]

Belton also made a statement regarding the trip to [[Canada]] by [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] and [[Peter Zokosky]] in which they were involved in the purchase of [[Valleyfield Chemical Corporation]] in [[Canada]] in May 1981. Belton claimed that [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] "used people in [[Canada]] to make sure he had an alibi when the Alvarez people were murdered on Bob Hope Drive."[^1]
