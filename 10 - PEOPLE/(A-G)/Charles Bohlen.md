Charles Bohlen (1904â€“1974) was a distinguished American diplomat who served as the U.S. Ambassador to the [[Soviet Union]] from 1953 to 1957. He was one of the ambassadors who was subjected to the [[Moscow Signal]], a microwave beam aimed at the [[U.S. Embassy in Moscow]] by the Soviets[^1].

Bohlen died of pancreatic cancer on January 1, 1974, at the age of sixty-nine. His death, along with that of [[Llewellyn Thomas]] and later [[Walter Stoessel Jr.]], raised concerns about the potential health effects of prolonged exposure to the Moscow Signal[^1].
