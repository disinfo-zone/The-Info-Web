Ephraim Evron, also known as Effy Evron, was an Israeli diplomat who served as the Israeli ambassador to [[Washington D.C.]]. He was a favorite of President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In early 1968, Evron was part of the Israeli delegation that attended the Johnson-Eshkol summit meeting in [[Texas]], where they argued against selling F-4s to [[Israel]]. Despite the arguments, Johnson privately assured Evron that [[Israel]] would get the F-4s, but that he would get something out of [[Levi Eshkol]] in return.[^1]
