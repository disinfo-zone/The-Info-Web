Sidney Gottlieb was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] chemist and spymaster, notorious for his involvement in controversial programs like [[Project MKUltra]], which explored mind control and chemical interrogation. In 1977, Gottlieb testified at a congressional hearing, revealing a strange complaint made by President [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]].[^1]

According to Gottlieb, Nixon claimed that he and several members of his staff, including his personal physician, Walter Tkach, had exhibited unusual behavior, including "inappropriate tears and crying," during a visit to an unnamed "potentially hostile country" in the early 1970s. Nixon visited both [[China]] and the [[Soviet Union]] in 1972. This incident, while not directly linked to psi research, contributed to the U.S. intelligence community's broader concerns about foreign influence and unconventional warfare.[^1]
