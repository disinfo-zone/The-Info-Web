Max Ben was a Princeton-trained pharmacologist who was helping the Israelis set up a pharmacology institute under [[United Nations]] auspices. He became a close friend and confidant of [[Ernst David Bergmann]] while in [[Israel]]. In 1966, Ben visited [[Dimona]] and was shown the nuclear facilities, leading him to believe that [[Israel]] was making nuclear warheads. He reported his findings to [[William N. Dale]], then deputy chief of mission at the American embassy, with the goal of informing [[Washington D.C.]] about [[Dimona]]'s accomplishments and seeing how the U.S. could assist [[Israel]].[^1]
