[[Robert Barnes]] was an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent at the San Francisco Bureau. He worked with [[Philip Arthur Thompson]] (PAT), who served as an undercover informant for him. Barnes admitted to Detective [[Sue Todd]] in June 2000 that PAT had worked for him.[^1]

Barnes was involved in a "reverse sting" operation where methamphetamine precursors were reportedly supplied to [[Ben Kalka]]. He was also the agent who cleared the laundering of millions of dollars through a principality in [[Liechtenstein]].[^1]

[[Michael Riconosciuto]] claimed that a chemical company was cooperating with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and reporting all the chemicals Riconosciuto ordered for his chemical companies in Washington State, which Riconosciuto then provided to [[Ben Kalka]]. Riconosciuto also stated that he was working for the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] when he connected with [[Ben Kalka]] and that the agency told him to find the monomethylamine for Kalka as part of the sting operation.[^1]

Barnes received three of [[Michael Riconosciuto]]'s computer coded cards from PAT, which he sent to Quantico. PAT, however, withheld one of the cards for himself. These cards were allegedly connected to the deaths of [[Paul Morasca]] and [[Mary Quick]].[^1]
