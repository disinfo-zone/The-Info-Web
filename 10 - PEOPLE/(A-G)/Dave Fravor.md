Commander [[Dave Fravor]] is a retired U.S. Navy pilot who is best known as the lead eyewitness in the 2004 [[Tic Tac Incident]] involving the [[USS Nimitz]] Carrier Strike Group. His credible testimony and detailed account of the encounter have been instrumental in bringing the issue of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) to the attention of the public and the U.S. Congress.[^1]

### Naval Career

A graduate of the prestigious Top Gun naval flight school, Commander Fravor was the commanding officer of the Black Aces squadron (VFA-41) at the time of the Tic Tac incident. He was considered one of the best pilots in the Navy, known for his skill and level-headedness in high-pressure situations.[^1]

### The Tic Tac Encounter

On November 14, 2004, while on a routine training mission off the coast of San Diego, Commander Fravor and his WSO, Commander Jim Slaight, were diverted to investigate a series of anomalous radar contacts that had been tracked by the [[USS Princeton]]. Fravor, along with a second F/A-18 piloted by Lieutenant Commander [[Alex Dietrich]], witnessed a white, oblong craft, later nicknamed the "Tic Tac," maneuvering erratically over a disturbance in the ocean.[^1]

Fravor descended to engage the object, which responded by mirroring his movements before accelerating at a speed he described as "like nothing I've ever seen." The object vanished in an instant, only to reappear on radar sixty miles away at the squadron's pre-arranged rendezvous point. Fravor's detailed and unwavering account of the incident, corroborated by the other pilots and the radar data, provided a solid foundation for the subsequent investigation by the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP).[^1]

### Role in Disclosure

In the years following the incident, Commander Fravor was hesitant to speak publicly about his experience due to the stigma surrounding the UAP topic. However, he was eventually debriefed by [[Luis Elizondo]] and [[Christopher Mellon]] and agreed to share his story. His testimony was featured in the groundbreaking 2017 New York Times article that revealed the existence of AATIP, and he has since become a key figure in the UAP disclosure movement.[^1]

He has provided briefings to members of Congress and their staff, and he testified under oath at a historic public hearing on UAP in July 2023. His credibility as a highly trained and respected naval aviator has been a crucial factor in legitimizing the UAP issue as a serious national security concern.[^1]
