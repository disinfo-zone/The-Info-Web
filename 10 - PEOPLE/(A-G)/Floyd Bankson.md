Floyd Bankson was a system engineer in the Criminal Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], involved with the implementation of Project Eagle. He was previously a secretary at the LEAA in 1977, where he worked with [[Lois Battistoni]].

[[Lois Battistoni]] alleged that Bankson told her that the DOJ intended to "bury [[Inslaw Corporation|Inslaw]]." However, Bankson absolutely denied these allegations. He stated that he never heard [[Lowell Jensen]] say anything derogatory about Inslaw, nor that Jensen pressured him to select the DALITE system for the DOJ's case tracking needs. Bankson also denied saying that the DOJ intended to "bury Inslaw" and was unaware of any wrongdoing related to [[PROMIS]] that needed to be concealed. According to Bankson, Battistoni "constantly" called him to ask if he had read various news articles, and he believed she enjoyed the publicity from Inslaw's allegations. The Special Counsel's investigation found no corroboration for Battistoni's claims from Bankson.[^1]
