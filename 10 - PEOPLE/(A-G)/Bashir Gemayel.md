[[Bashir Gemayel]] was elected president of [[Lebanon]] after the 1982 Israeli invasion. He was reportedly on the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] payroll. Before he could take office, Gemayel was killed by an assassin's bomb. His brother, [[Amin Gamayel]], was subsequently installed as president.[^1]

[[George K. Pender]], President of [[First Intercontinental Development Corporation|FIDCO]], stated in a letter to [[Amin Gamayel]] that he was a good friend of Bashir and had been with him in Beirut in 1976 when the Syrian Army arrived. Pender also mentioned meeting Bashir in Framingham, Massachusetts, during a U.S. speaking tour.[^1]
