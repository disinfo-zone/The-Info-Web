Alice Astor Bouverie was an American heiress, philanthropist, and the only daughter of John Jacob Astor IV, who died in the sinking of the RMS Titanic. She was a significant financial supporter of [[Andrija Puharich]]'s paranormal research.[^1]

In 1948, Bouverie became the first major benefactor of Puharich's [[Round Table Foundation]], providing an initial check of $106,000. She served as the organization's first vice president. Her interest in [[ESP]], particularly mental telepathy, stemmed from her father, who wrote science fiction novels about the subject.[^1]
