The Gokal brothers, [[Abbas Gokal]], [[Murtaza Gokal]], and [[Mustafa Gokal]], were [[Pakistan|Pakistani]] businessmen who ran the [[Gulf Group]], a [[London]]-based shipping company.[^1] They were closely associated with [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] and the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], and were believed to be BCCI's largest debtor.[^2]

### Business Operations and BCCI Connections

The Gokal brothers used BCCI money to build their shipping empire, chartering more ships in one year than [[China]] and [[India]] combined during their heyday.[^3] Their loans from BCCI topped out at $831 million in 1990 and were never repaid, contributing significantly to BCCI's financial problems.[^4]

[[Mustafa Gokal]] was named Pakistan's minister for shipping, a position facilitated by Abedi, highlighting the intertwined relationship between BCCI and the Pakistani government.[^5] The Gokal brothers were also used by BCCI as a front for various transactions, including an attempt to acquire Chelsea National Bank in [[New York]] in 1975.[^6]
