Scott Carmichael is a former analyst with the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]. He worked with [[Angela Dellafiora]], one of the DIA's most valuable remote viewers, on various intelligence operations[^1].

Carmichael was involved in the investigation surrounding the abduction of Marine Lieutenant Colonel [[William Richard Higgins]] in [[Lebanon]]. He confirmed that the [[FBI]]'s examination of the videotape released by [[Hezbollah]] showed that Higgins's feet projected out with the ankles at right angles, not with toes pointed straight down, indicating that Higgins had died before he was hanged. This detail, which Dellafiora had perceived as a clue about Higgins's "feet," played into the investigation and proved he had already been killed[^1].
