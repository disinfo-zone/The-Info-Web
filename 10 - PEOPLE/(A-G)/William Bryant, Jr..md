[[William Bryant, Jr.]] was a Senior [[United States District Court|U.S. District Court]] Judge. He affirmed the bankruptcy court's findings in November 1989, in a separate opinion of almost 50 pages, following a de novo trial in the [[INSLAW]] case. His ruling stated that "There was unending contention about payments under this contract and the rights of the respective parties – what is strikingly apparent from the testimony and depositions of key witnesses and many documents is that [[INSLAW]] performed its contract in a hostile environment that extended from the higher echelons of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to the officials who had the day-to-day responsibility for supervising its work."[^1]
