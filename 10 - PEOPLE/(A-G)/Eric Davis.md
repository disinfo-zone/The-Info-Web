[[Eric Davis]] is an astrophysicist with high-level national security clearances who has worked as a contractor and consultant for the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and other government programs. He is known for his expertise in advanced propulsion physics and is the alleged author of the [[Wilson-Davis Memo]].[^1]

### Scientific Career and Government Work

Dr. Davis has a long history of consulting for aerospace and defense contractors, including EarthTech, the company founded by [[Harold "Hal" Puthoff]]. He is known for his brilliant and maverick approach to science, and he has an eidetic memory. He has provided the Presidential Daily Briefing (PDB) and has briefed numerous DoD agencies and congressional committees on the UAP issue.[^1]

### Involvement with AATIP

Dr. Davis was a key scientific contractor for AATIP, working closely with [[Harold "Hal" Puthoff]] and [[Luis Elizondo]]. He was instrumental in analyzing the physics of UAP and exploring theoretical concepts such as warp drives and traversable wormholes. His expertise was crucial in helping the AATIP team to understand the advanced capabilities of the craft they were investigating.[^1]

### The Wilson-Davis Memo

Dr. Davis is best known as the alleged author of the [[Wilson-Davis Memo]], a document that details a 2002 conversation with Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson, then the Director of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA). The memo describes Admiral Wilson's discovery of and subsequent denial of access to a secret UAP reverse-engineering program. The leak of this memo has been a significant event in the UAP disclosure movement, providing a detailed account of the existence of a "Legacy Program" operating outside of normal government oversight.[^1]

In 2020, Dr. Davis made headlines when he told the New York Times that the U.S. government was in possession of "off-world vehicles not made on this earth." His public statements and briefings to Congress have been a major factor in the growing momentum for UAP transparency.[^1]
