Lieutenant General [[James Clapper]] was a [[U.S. Air Force]] officer who later served as the Director of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] and subsequently as the Director of National Intelligence. In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], Clapper was involved with the program in the 1990s, serving as a project leader. His involvement highlights the continued, albeit evolving, interest in [[Psi|psychic]] phenomena within the U.S. intelligence community even in later stages of the program's existence[^1].

In 1991, after the *Associated Press* broke the story about [[PSI Tech]] and its involvement in finding [[Saddam Hussein]]'s weapon sites, Clapper, then Director of the DIA, faced intense scrutiny. He stated that he and his three predecessors had all tried to kill the program, finding it "too far out at the leading edge of technology to maintain very well as an ongoing intelligence activity"[^2].

Despite his efforts to terminate the program, Clapper noted that [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] mandated its sustenance through specific language in appropriations. He categorized the [[Department of Defense]]'s [[Extrasensory Perception|ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis|PK]] research as "leading edge technology," rather than parapsychology[^2].

In 2016, Clapper was asked to join a classified science advisory board for the Director of National Intelligence, indicating his continued influence in the intelligence community[^2].
