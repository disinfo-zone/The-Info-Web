[[Oscar Guerrero]] was a freelance journalist from [[Colombia]]. He met [[Mordecai Vanunu]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], where [[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu]] was sharing top-secret photographs of [[Israel|Israel's]] nuclear facility.[^1]

[[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] saw the photographs and proposed publishing them for a fee. He first approached *The Sydney Morning Herald*, but the photographs were rejected. His approach was, however, passed on to the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organization|Australian Security Intelligence Organization]] (ASIO) and then to the [[Australian Security Intelligence Service|Australian Security Intelligence Service]] (ASIS), who informed [[Israel]].[[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] then tried *The Age* newspaper in [[Melbourne]], and later the [[London]] papers.[^1]

[[Nicholas Davies]], a London *Daily Mirror* foreign editor and [[Israel|Israeli]] agent, stalled [[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] by telling him the newspaper needed an expert to check his claims. [[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] had already struck a deal with *The Sunday Times* to publish [[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu's]] story and photographs, with [[Mordecai Vanunu|Vanunu]] receiving a Â£250,000 advance on a book and [[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] receiving a 10% cut. [[Oscar Guerrero|Guerrero]] approached the *Mirror* because he believed he was being cut out of *The Sunday Times* deal.[^1]
