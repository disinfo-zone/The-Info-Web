[[Alan Bond]] was a wealthy [[Australia|Australian]] businessman. He was involved in joint ventures with [[Carlos Cardoen]] and had connections to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s operations.[^1]

In 1987, a contribution was made to the West Australian Labor Party from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], involving [[Richard Babayan]] and [[Earl Brian]] acting on behalf of [[Hadron]]. This money was passed on by one of [[Robert Maxwell|Maxwell's]] companies in [[Australia]] to be held by the [[Pergamon Press Trust Fund]] in [[Moscow]]. [[Richard Babayan|Babayan]] handed the check to [[Yosef Goldberg]], who in turn gave it to [[Alan Bond|Bond]] in his role as the guardian of the [[John Curtin Foundation]] funds.[^1]

[[Alan Bond|Bond]] invested loans obtained from various [[Australia|Australian]] banks into [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen's]] construction company in [[Iraq]], which was building a vast "agricultural complex" outside [[Baghdad]]. He also purchased the Chilean phone company from [[Augusto Pinochet|President Pinochet]] for approximately $300 million, making promises of improvements that were not fulfilled.[^1]

In late September 1988, an [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence officer briefed the head of [[Australian Security and Intelligence Services|ASIS]] about [[Alan Bond|Bond's]] activities in [[Chile]]. Following this, [[Alan Bond|Bond]] almost immediately pulled out of [[Carlos Cardoen|Cardoen Industries]] and later out of [[Chile]] altogether.[^1]

[[Alan Bond|Bond]] was convicted of bank fraud in May 1992 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison. He later went bankrupt and became involved in African mining investments.[^1]
