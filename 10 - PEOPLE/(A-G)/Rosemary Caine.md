"[[Rosemary Caine]]" is the pseudonym for a former intelligence case officer who, along with [[Jay Stratton]], recruited [[Luis Elizondo]] into the [[Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program]] (AAWSAP), the precursor to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP).[^1]

### Recruitment of Luis Elizondo

In early 2009, "Rosemary Caine" and [[Jay Stratton]] approached [[Luis Elizondo]] at his [[Pentagon]] office to recruit him for a highly classified program at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA). Elizondo describes her as cool, calm, and beautiful, and he later learned that she was a fluent Russian speaker and a former intelligence case officer. She was one of the few intelligence professionals who would have been just as comfortable on the cover of Vogue magazine as sporting camouflage and wielding an AK-47. She could work in any environment, and thatâ€™s what made her lethal.[^1]

"Caine" was present at the initial meetings with Elizondo, where she and Stratton explained that the program was focused on "unconventional technologies" and required a senior intelligence officer to handle counterintelligence and security. Her role in the initial recruitment was crucial in bringing Elizondo into the UAP investigation effort.[^1]
