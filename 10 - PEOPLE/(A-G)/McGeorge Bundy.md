McGeorge Bundy served as the National Security Advisor to President [[John F. Kennedy]]. He desperately sought to cut [[Myer Feldman]] out of the flow of [[Middle East]] paperwork due to Feldman's strong pro-Israel bias, which often resulted in bureaucratic chaos within the White House staff. Bundy was suspicious of Feldman and also anxious about other Jewish National Security Council staff members handling Israeli issues.[^1]
