[[Anwar Sadat]] was the President of [[Egypt]]. In 1978, he successfully concluded the [[Camp David Accords|Camp David summit]] with Israeli Prime Minister [[Menachem Begin]], a significant step towards peace in the [[Middle East]].[^2]

He was informed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] about [[Israel|Israel's]] attitude towards a comprehensive peace settlement in the [[Middle East]], following [[Golda Meir|Golda Meir's]] meeting with [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1972. This intelligence may have prompted [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] to launch a war against [[Israel]] in 1973 to force them to the peace table.[^1]

[[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] and [[Menachem Begin]] later developed a face-saving formula over the Palestinian issue, leading to the [[Camp David Accords]]. [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] was primarily interested in regaining the [[Sinai Desert|Sinai]] for [[Egypt]] and was not keen on the [[Gaza Strip]] due to its large Palestinian population.[^1]
