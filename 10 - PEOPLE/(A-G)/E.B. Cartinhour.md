[[E.B. Cartinhour]] was an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent from Lexington, Kentucky. According to [[Ari Ben-Menashe]], Cartinhour was one of two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents who had been en route to Martinsburg to meet [[Danny Casolaro]] as part of their investigation into the sale of the [[PROMIS]] software to [[Israel]] and other intelligence agencies. Ben-Menashe claimed that Cartinhour was disaffected because his superiors had refused to indict high [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] officials for their role in the [[October Surprise]]. Ben-Menashe further alleged that the agents were prepared to give Casolaro proof that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was illegally using [[PROMIS]] software.[^1]
