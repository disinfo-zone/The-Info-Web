Rob Cowart was a Captain in military intelligence and one of the two military intelligence officers personally trained by [[Ingo Swann]] in [[Coordinate Remote Viewing|CRV]] techniques. In 1982, he was read onto the classified [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program[^1].

The plan was for Cowart and [[Tom McNear]], the other trainee, to become the program's CRV trainers. However, McNear later noted that Cowart was medically retired due to cancer, which contributed to McNear's decision to leave the unit[^1].
