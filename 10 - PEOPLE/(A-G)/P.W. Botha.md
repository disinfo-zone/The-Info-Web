[[P.W. Botha]] was the Prime Minister and later President of [[South Africa]]. He also served as Defense Minister. He played a key role in developing [[South Africa|South Africa's]] military and nuclear capabilities.[^1]

In 1978, [[Menachem Begin|Prime Minister Begin]] dispatched [[Ezer Weizman]], then [[Israel|Israeli]] Defense Minister, to [[Pretoria]] to meet [[P.W. Botha|Botha]] to discuss [[Israel|Israeli]]-[[South Africa|South African]] relations. Despite [[Menachem Begin|Begin's]] intentions to downgrade the relationship, [[Ezer Weizman|Weizman]] agreed with [[P.W. Botha|Botha]] on a wartime alliance between the two governments as the price for continuing nuclear tests. This led to the creation of [[SIMWA]] (SADF-IDF Mutual Wartime Agreement).[^1]
