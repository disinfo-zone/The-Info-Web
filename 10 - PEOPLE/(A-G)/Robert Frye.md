[[Robert Frye]] was the Executive Vice President of [[Wackenhut Corporation]] in Indio, [[California]]. He was involved in the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation|Cabazon]]/[[Wackenhut Corporation]] Joint Venture, which aimed to develop and manufacture arms on the reservation.[^1]

Frye met with [[Michael Riconosciuto]] and [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] at Picatinny Arsenal in May 1981, where Riconosciuto conducted a theoretical blackboard exercise on a Railgun for [[Dr. Harry Fair]]. Frye was present when Dr. Fair commented on Riconosciuto's scientific and technical knowledge, terming him a "potential national resource."[^1]

Frye suffered a heart attack in early April 1983 and was hospitalized. After this, he never traveled to [[California]] to meet with [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] or the Cabazons again. [[Wackenhut Corporation]]'s involvement with the Cabazon Joint Venture virtually ceased, and it was formally terminated in October 1984.[^1]

[[Robert Chasen]], Executive Vice President of [[Wackenhut Corporation]] in Coral Gables, stated that Frye went behind his back in facilitating the biological warfare technology project at the Indio facility. Chasen believed Frye and [[Dick Wilson]] were "dazzled" with [[Robert Booth Nichols]], despite Chasen's own distrust of Nichols.[^1]
