James Callaghan, also known as Lord Callaghan, was a former [[Great Britain|British]] prime minister who served as a paid economic adviser to the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]].[^1] His association with BCCI was part of [[Agha Hasan Abedi]]'s strategy to cultivate relationships with influential figures and enhance the bank's image.

### Political Career

Callaghan had a distinguished political career in the [[United Kingdom]], culminating in his tenure as Prime Minister. His involvement with BCCI highlights the bank's reach into high-level political circles.

### Role with BCCI

Callaghan's role as an economic adviser to BCCI provided the bank with a veneer of legitimacy and access to political networks. He accompanied Abedi on visits to various countries, such as [[Zambia]], where they engaged in carefully stage-managed acts of philanthropy. For instance, in Zambia, Callaghan was present when Abedi announced a crucial loan and donated money to a charitable trust, actions that significantly boosted Abedi's reputation as a champion of the Third World. These joint appearances with Abedi in countries like Zambia, [[Kenya]], [[Ghana]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Soviet Union]] served to further BCCI's business development and image as a philanthropic institution.[^2]
