[[Rachel Begley]] is the daughter of [[Ralph Boger]], who was murdered in a triple homicide in Rancho Mirage, [[California]], in June 1981. She was 13 years old at the time of her father's death. For 28 years, Begley sought justice for the murders of her father, [[Fred Alvarez]], and [[Patricia Castro]], actively investigating the execution-style slaying and gathering documents and secretly taping interviews with suspects.[^1]

Begley's efforts led to Detective [[John Powers]] at the Riverside Sheriff's Department being assigned to the cold-case file in 2007. She worked closely with Powers, providing him with information and documents, including a 77-page Matrix Link Analysis she had compiled and a 10-page outline of corporate structures and joint ventures related to the individuals in the Matrix. She also encouraged Powers to obtain copies of the "Paul Morasca Homicide Investigation File" and the "Di Giorgio Extradition File," which proved instrumental in the investigation.[^1]

Begley confronted [[Jimmy Hughes]] at a FGBMFI dinner event on February 22, 2008, accusing him of being the "bagman" in her father's murder. She recorded his response, where he admitted to being a "Mafia hit-man" and killing people for the government. This recording was later made public on her website.[^1]

Begley launched a desperate campaign with media, Internet websites, and political figures, including [[California Attorney General]] [[Jerry Brown]], to motivate the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]] to issue an arrest warrant for [[Jimmy Hughes]]. Her efforts, along with prodding from [[John Powers]], led to Hughes' arrest on September 26, 2009, at Miami-Dade International Airport. She was officially present at the arrest scene to confirm Hughes' identity.[^1]

Despite Hughes' arrest, the case was later dismissed on July 1, 2010, due to the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]]'s decision to drop the charges. Begley expressed her disbelief and determination to continue fighting for justice, hiring attorney [[Robin Sax]] to represent her. She believes the evidence she found was more than sufficient and that the dismissal was an "unethical dismissal" and a "miscarriage of justice."[^1]

Begley's extraordinary computer expertise and tracking skills were noted by [[John Powers]]. Her website, Desertfae.com, attracted observers from various government agencies, organized crime members, and other interested parties, who monitored her documents and videos. She also received threats from individuals close to Hughes after his arrest.[^1]
