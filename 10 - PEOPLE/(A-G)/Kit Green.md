Christopher "[[Kit Green]]" was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analyst and neurophysiologist in the Life Sciences Division. He played a crucial role in the CIA's oversight of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], particularly in overseeing the medical and scientific aspects of the program.[^1]

Green was personally involved in the [[Uri Geller]] matter, serving as Geller's handler and overseeing his tests at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. He was responsible for administering medical tests on the psychics, including blood tests, brain scans, and personality assessments, with the aim of understanding the physiological correlates of psychic abilities.[^1]

Green was also involved in the Sugar Grove incident, where [[Pat Price]] and [[Ingo Swann]] accurately remote-viewed a secret [[NSA]] facility. He later investigated the bizarre apparitions experienced by scientists at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] after their involvement with Geller, concluding that they were likely the result of a high-technology psychological operation.[^1]

Despite his scientific background, Green acknowledged the reality of psychic phenomena, stating that he had observed phenomena for which he had no scientific explanation. However, he was critical of the Army's approach to training soldiers as psychic spies, believing that only a select few individuals possessed genuine psychic abilities.[^1]
