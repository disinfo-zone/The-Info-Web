[[Michael Del Gaizo]] operated Northstar Graphics in [[New Jersey]]. He was under investigation in 1987 for various suspected offenses, including extortion, insider trading (MCA/Universal), the purchase and sale of narcotics/controlled substances, and the allocation and use of the proceeds of its trafficking.[^1]

[[Eugene Giaquinto]] had awarded a multi-million dollar contract to Northstar Graphics. [[Sidney Sheinberg]], President of [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]/Universal, was critical of Giaquinto giving the contract to Northstar. Giaquinto expressed concern that Del Gaizo might carry out some type of threat or violence against Sheinberg to retain the contract.[^1]
