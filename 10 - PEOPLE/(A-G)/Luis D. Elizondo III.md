[[Luis D. Elizondo III]] was the father of [[Luis Elizondo]]. He was a Cuban exile with a revolutionary past who had a profound and unconventional influence on his son's upbringing.[^1]

### Revolutionary Past and Imprisonment

In his youth, Luis D. Elizondo III fought alongside Fidel Castro against the Batista regime in Cuba. However, when Castro aligned with the Soviet Union and declared himself president for life, Elizondo III joined the resistance. He participated in the [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion as a member of Brigade 2506 and was subsequently captured and imprisoned in Cuba for two years. His experiences in prison, which included enduring oral surgery without anesthesia, left him a volatile and deeply anti-authoritarian man.[^1]

### Influence on Luis Elizondo

After his release and relocation to the United States, Elizondo III provided his son with an intense and unusual education in paramilitary skills from a very young age. He taught his son how to assemble and disassemble firearms, build rocket launchers, read topographical maps, and other survival skills. This was all part of his preparation for a planned, but never realized, second invasion of Cuba under an operation known as "Alpha 66."[^1]

This unconventional upbringing, while difficult, instilled in [[Luis Elizondo]] a unique set of skills and a resilience that would serve him throughout his career in military intelligence.[^1]
