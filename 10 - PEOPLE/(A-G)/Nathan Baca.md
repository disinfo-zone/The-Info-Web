[[Nathan Baca]] is a reporter for KESQ-TV, News Channel 3. He won a regional Emmy for his 35-part series entitled "The Octopus Murders," which focused on the [[Fred Alvarez]] triple homicide case. At the podium, while accepting his Emmy Award, Baca stated, "I do this in memory of murder victims [[Ralph Boger]], [[Fred Alvarez]] and [[Patricia Castro]]. I hope and pray that justice, a justice that has been delayed for far too many years, will soon be had by the families of these victims."[^1]

Baca interviewed [[Glen Heggstad]], who provided him with a book he had written, autographed with a note urging Baca to seek the truth and keep an open mind, as "just because a cop or prosecutor says something, doesn't make it true."[^1]

Baca's news report on July 2, 2010, aired a segment of a 25-year-old interview in which [[Jimmy Hughes]] said that the [[Fred Alvarez]] triple homicide in 1981 was an "ordered assassination," and that he was only the bagman. Hughes told the reporter, [[Patrick Healy]], in the 1985 news clip that the hit was an "authorized, backed, government covert action."[^1]
