Andrew J. Goodpaster was an American Army General who served as military aide to President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and later to President [[Richard M. Nixon]]. He recalled that diplomatic exchanges between Eisenhower and [[David Ben-Gurion]] regarding [[Dimona]] were "very closely held" and not available even to close subordinates at the time. While there was presidential concern about "what they were doing at [[Dimona]]," Goodpaster could not remember any "specific exchange about a nuclear umbrella."[^1]
