Antonio Savasta was a member of the [[Red Brigades]], a Marxist-Leninist paramilitary group responsible for the kidnapping of Brigadier General [[James L. Dozier]] in Verona, [[Italy]], on December 17, 1981[^1].

Savasta was present in the apartment where Dozier was held captive. When Italian Special Forces stormed the apartment to rescue Dozier, Savasta was holding a gun to the General's head. However, before he could pull the trigger, a commando hit him from behind with the butt of a machine gun, knocking him to the floor. This action led to Dozier's successful rescue after 42 days in captivity[^1].
