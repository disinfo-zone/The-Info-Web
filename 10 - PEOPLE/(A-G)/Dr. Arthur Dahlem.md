[[Dr. Arthur Dahlem]] was the Mariposa doctor and close friend of [[Roderick Sinclair]]. He had been prescribing heavy sedatives to Sinclair for years. Assistant [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]] [[James White]] in Fresno ordered Dahlem's files seized to prove Sinclair's alleged drug use in connection with the "[[Queen's accident]]."[^1]

[[Shaula Brent]], a manager at B. Dalton Bookseller who had worked at Fremont Hospital when Sinclair was brought in, recounted that Sinclair had been receiving huge daily shots of Demerol, "enough to kill most men," by order of Dr. Arthur Dahlem. After the Queen's accident, all drugs were withdrawn from Sinclair, and employees could hear him suffering aloud for days from his hospital room.[^1]
