[[Bob Bickel]] was a Texas oil engineer who once worked as an informant for the Customs Bureau. He was a friend and confidante of investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]].[^1]

Bickel was a key source for Casolaro's "[[The Octopus]]" investigation. Casolaro obtained papers related to [[Iran-Contra Affair|Iran-Contra]] arms deals, including photocopies of checks drawn on [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] accounts for [[Adnan Khashoggi]] and [[Manucher Ghorbanifar]], from Bickel. Bickel, in turn, obtained these documents from [[October Surprise]] source [[Richard Brenneke]].[^1]

In the last days before his death, Casolaro discussed [[Michael Abbell]], [[Robert Booth Nichols]], and the [[Cali Drug Cartel]] at length with Bickel. Bickel confirmed that Casolaro confronted Nichols about his relationship with Abbell. Bickel's confirmation of Casolaro's focus on [[Michael Abbell]] in the days leading up to his death suggested that Casolaro may have unknowingly stepped into a large narcotics trafficking and intelligence operation.[^1]
