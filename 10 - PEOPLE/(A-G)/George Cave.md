[[George Cave]] was a longtime [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] official and an [[Iran|Iranian]] expert, fluent in Farsi. He was officially purged from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] in 1977 but remained active until 1989. His career was somewhat parallel to [[Ari Ben-Menashe|Ben-Menashe's]].[^1]

[[George Cave|Cave]] was a member of what [[Israel]] called the "[[Iran Group]]," headed by [[Robert Gates]], which was created as a result of the October 1980 [[Paris meeting]]. Due to his expertise on [[Iran]], he participated with the [[Israel|Israelis]] in arms sales. He became well-known in [[Washington D.C.]] circles and was very close to [[Robert Gates|Gates]].[^1]

[[George Cave|Cave]] was present at the October 1980 [[Paris meeting]], along with [[George Bush]], [[William Casey]], [[Robert McFarlane]], and [[Donald Gregg]]. He was also present at the [[Santiago]] meeting in late 1986, where [[USA|U.S.]] officials reaffirmed their intention to maintain arms channels to [[Iraq]].[^1]

In February 1989, [[George Cave|Cave]] was spotted in [[Paraguay]] with [[Earl Brian]], visiting [[Andres Rodriguez|Gen. Andres Rodriguez]] prior to the coup against [[Alfredo Stroessner|President Stroessner]]. [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] confronted [[George Cave|Cave]] about his presence, and [[George Cave|Cave]] claimed to be there on personal business.[^1]

[[George Cave|Cave]] was named as an enemy of the state by an [[Israel|Israeli]] intelligence committee in March 1989, due to his involvement in supplying [[Iraq]] with chemical weapons and nuclear technology.[^1]
