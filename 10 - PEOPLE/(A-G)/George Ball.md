George Ball served as the Under Secretary of State during the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration. His office was responsible for rewriting [[William R. Crawford]]'s draft letter from President Kennedy to [[David Ben-Gurion]] regarding [[Israel]]'s nuclear program at [[Dimona]]. Ball's office held onto the letter for days, eventually provoking a complaint from the White House, and when his rewritten version emerged, it had the same message but in "JFK prose."[^1]
