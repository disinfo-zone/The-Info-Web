[[Peter Zokosky]] was an arms manufacturer and a key figure in various covert operations and business ventures, often associated with [[Robert Booth Nichols]] and [[Michael Riconosciuto]]. He was a former president of [[Armtec]], a company that produced combustible cartridge cases for the Army, and was under a non-compete agreement with them until August 1981. Zokosky also served as a consultant to the [[Great Britain|British Government]] on shell casings.[^1]

### Involvement in Cabazon/Wackenhut Joint Venture

Zokosky was a key participant in the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation|Cabazon]]/[[Wackenhut Corporation]] Joint Venture, which aimed to develop and manufacture arms on the reservation. He was considered crucial due to his expertise in the slurry process involved in combustible cartridge cases. He met with [[Michael Riconosciuto]], [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]], and [[Robert Frye]] at [[Picatinny Arsenal]] in May 1981, where Riconosciuto demonstrated his scientific and technical knowledge of weapons systems, particularly on a Railgun. Zokosky was also present at the September 10, 1981, Lake Cahuilla weapons demonstration in Indio, [[California]], where night-vision goggles and rifles were tested for [[Iran-Contra Affair|Contra]] leaders.[^1]

### Biological Warfare Technology

Zokosky was involved in the proposed development of biological warfare "viruses" at [[Stormont Laboratories]], allegedly developed in cow uteri. He, along with [[Robert Booth Nichols]], presented a proposal to develop biological warfare technology and anti-toxin kits to the Army ([[Dr. Harry Fair]] at Picatinny Arsenal) and to [[FMC Corporation]]. This technology was described as capable of selectively wiping out segments of humanity with appropriate genetic material. Zokosky also discussed incubating viruses in fish tanks at [[Hercules Research]], where [[Michael Riconosciuto]] allegedly worked on the same technology.[^1]

### Connections to Robert Booth Nichols and Meridian International Logistics

Zokosky was a board member of [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]], a holding company headed by [[Robert Booth Nichols]]. He stated that [[Meridian International Logistics|MIL]] was a "front company" used to funnel money to its board of directors, with funds allegedly coming from the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], partly from drug profits. He believed that [[Robert Booth Nichols]] worked for the [[National Security Council|NSC]] and [[National Security Agency|NSA]], doing "contract work" for various government agencies, and that Nichols handled "corporate and government" transactions related to narcotics at a higher level.[^1]

Zokosky and Nichols were involved in a proposed joint venture with FMC Corporation, where [[Michael Riconosciuto]] was Vice President of [[Meridian Arms]]. Zokosky also discussed [[Robert Booth Nichols]] and [[Michael Riconosciuto]] conducting business in [[Australia]], which he thought had something to do with the [[Nugan Hand Bank]].[^1]

### Role in "The Octopus" Investigation

[[Peter Zokosky]] was a key source for [[Cheri Seymour]]'s investigation into "[[The Octopus]]." He provided Seymour with a copy of the "Special Operations [Surveillance] Report" on the Lake Cahuilla meeting, which he had obtained from a friend in Washington D.C. He also provided an audio-taped conversation with [[Michael Riconosciuto]] narrating the murders of [[Paul Morasca]] and [[Mary Quick]], and their connection to drug operations. Zokosky stated that [[Paul Morasca]] was killed due to a "narcotics deal" gone awry and his involvement in laundering drug profits.[^1]

Zokosky was initially defensive about [[Danny Casolaro]]'s death, stating he believed Casolaro committed suicide, though his wife, [[Regina Zokosky]], indicated he had previously said otherwise. He allowed [[Cheri Seymour]] and [[Kelly O'Meara]] to review a manuscript written by [[Robert Booth Nichols]] about [[Danny Casolaro]]'s death, titled "Danny Casolaro's Octopus."[^1]

He also provided [[Cheri Seymour]] with a handwritten "Time Line" outlining a chronology of events from 1981 to 1985, which proved helpful in the investigation of the [[Fred Alvarez]] triple murders. Zokosky confirmed that [[Dr. John Philip Nichols]] had an alibi for the Alvarez murders, as he was in [[Canada]] with Zokosky at the time.[^1]

### Other Connections

Zokosky claimed to have served in ONI ([[Office of Naval Intelligence]]) in submarines during [[World War II]] and performed "[[remote viewing]]" for the military between the 1950s and 1970s at [[Hewlett Packard Corporation]]. He also identified himself as a psychic and a member of the [[Psychic Association of London]], using Tarot Cards for readings.[^1]

He was an investor in the [[Cabazon Casino]] and a skeet range, though he stated that the Mob built the Casino for the Cabazons. He also testified on behalf of [[Patrick McGuire]] at the [[Montana Freeman trial]].[^1]
