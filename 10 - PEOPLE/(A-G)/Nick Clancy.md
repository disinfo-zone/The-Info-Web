Nick Clancy was a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer whose job for several years had been to conduct technical penetrations of embassies in Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East. He worked closely with [[Ken Kress]] and was involved in the testing of [[Pat Price]]'s remote viewing abilities.[^1]

Clancy was present during Price's three preliminary tests for Staff D, designed to assess Price's suitability for a high-stakes operation involving a Chinese Embassy basement. He witnessed Price's remarkable accuracy in describing the layout of the Chinese Embassy in Africa, including details like a poorly lit hallway that Clancy himself had experienced during an operation. He was so shaken by Price's accuracy that he described the evening as an "eight-martini evening."[^1]

However, Clancy also witnessed Price's temporal displacement during a remote viewing session of a North African embassy, where Price described the building as a dormitory or hospital from an earlier time period, complete with beds and injured people, and without a large iron gate that existed in the present. This incident highlighted the complexities and potential pitfalls of remote viewing across time.[^1]
