# Robert O. Becker

Robert O. Becker was a physician and researcher who worked on microwave weapons for the [[Department of Defense]]. He was a colleague of [[Samuel Koslov]] and [[Allan H. Frey]], and was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize[^1].

Becker's work convinced him that a microwave signal, such as the [[Moscow Signal]], "could affect the central nervous system, put people to sleep, interfere with decision making capacity and induce chronic stress"[^1]. He noted that the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] had been "using embassy employees as test subjects for low-level [[Electromagnetic Radiation|EMR]] experiments"[^1].

Becker resigned from his government work in the early 1970s after working on a classified project that used microwaves to disorient people, reportedly because he considered such work immoral[^1]. He believed that it was technically feasible to produce heart attacks with an electromagnetic ray designed to penetrate the human chest, echoing the alleged abilities of [[Ninel Kulagina]] to stop an animal's heart with her mind[^1].
