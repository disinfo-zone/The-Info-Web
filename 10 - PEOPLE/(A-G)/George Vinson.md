[[George Vinson]] was the regional director of the Fresno [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. He was named in a Writ of Mandamus filed by [[Ben Wagner]] for refusing to investigate corruption in Mariposa County. [[Vivian L. Wagner]], Ben Wagner's wife, stated in a letter to President [[Ronald Reagan]] that her husband took two witnesses, [[Kay Ritter]] and [[Robert Ashmore]], to Vinson to present testimony, but Vinson failed to redress their grievances and did not return Ben Wagner's phone calls. It was understood through a reliable source that Vinson felt the complaints had "no substance."[^1]
