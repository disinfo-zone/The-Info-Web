John Berberich was a Division Chief at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]]. In October 1990, he became the new DIA division chief and gave [[Dale Graff]] the position of branch chief at [[Fort Meade]], placing Graff in charge of the [[Remote Viewing]] program, which was then renamed [[STARGATE PROJECT|Star Gate]][^1].

Berberich's decision to appoint Graff to this leadership role indicated a shift in the program's management, aiming for a more operationally effective approach. In May 1991, Berberich, along with Graff and three remote viewers (including [[Angela Dellafiora]]), traveled to [[England]], [[Germany]], and [[Israel]] as part of an annual intelligence exchange, further highlighting his involvement in the program's international engagements[^1].
