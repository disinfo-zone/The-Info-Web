[[Arthur Welmas]] was the Tribal Chairman of the [[Cabazon Band of Mission Indians]]. He signed a letter on behalf of [[Jimmy Hughes]] to the Army Discharge Review Board, requesting Hughes' military record to obtain security clearances for his work in the [[Cabazon Indian Reservation|Cabazon]]/[[Wackenhut Corporation]] Joint Venture.[^1]

[[Robert Chasen]], Executive Vice President of [[Wackenhut Corporation]], felt an affinity with Welmas due to his wife being part Cherokee. Chasen sympathized with the Cabazons' situation and expressed a desire to protect them, suggesting he may have done so by shutting down the [[Wackenhut Corporation]]'s biological virus and vaccine development proposal to the Army on the Cabazon reservation.[^1]
