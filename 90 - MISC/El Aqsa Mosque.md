The [[El Aqsa Mosque]] is located on the [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]], considered by Muslims to be the holiest place after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. It is built over a rock imprinted with a footstep said to be that of the Prophet [[Mohammed]], who ascended to heaven from that spot.[^1]

In August 1969, the [[El Aqsa Mosque]] was the target of an arson attack carried out by [[Michael Dennis Rohan]], an [[Australia|Australian]] member of the Church of God. [[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan]] believed that destroying the mosque was necessary for the rebuilding of the Third Temple and the return of Christ. This act outraged Muslims worldwide and led to calls for a jihad against [[Israel]]. [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] played a role in exposing [[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan's]] involvement and his connections with the [[Jewish Defense League]] (JDL).[^1]
