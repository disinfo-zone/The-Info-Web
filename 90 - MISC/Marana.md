[[Marana]] is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] airbase located near [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]]. It served as a collection point for weapons purchased by the [[USA|U.S.]] government for transfer to [[Israel]] and subsequently to [[Iran]].[^1]

The first batch of weapons from [[Marana]] was flown out in October 1981. In February 1987, 4,000 [[TOW missile]]s were flown out of [[Marana]] Base to [[Guatemala]] and then shipped through [[Australia]] as part of a large-scale arms supply operation to [[Iran]].[^1]
