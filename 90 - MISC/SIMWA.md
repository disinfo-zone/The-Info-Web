[[SIMWA]] (SADF-IDF Mutual Wartime Agreement) was a military cooperation agreement drawn up between the [[South African Defense Force]] (SADF) and the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF). It was created in 1978-1979, after [[Ezer Weizman]], then [[Israel|Israeli]] Defense Minister, agreed with [[P.W. Botha]], Prime Minister of [[South Africa]], on a wartime alliance as the price for continuing nuclear tests.[^1]

The [[SIMWA|agreement]] stipulated that if either country faced a shortage of mat√©riel during war or military operations, the other country would provide supplies from its own stockpiles. It also included a provision for an annual meeting of the deputy chiefs of general staff, alternating between [[Israel]] and [[South Africa]].[^1]

Under this [[SIMWA|agreement]], [[Israel]] sold 175mm artillery that could carry small nuclear devices to [[South Africa]]. [[South Africa]] also agreed to invest in [[Israel|Israel's]] nuclear program and provide testing grounds in the [[Indian Ocean]] for [[Israel|Israeli]] nuclear tests.[^1]
