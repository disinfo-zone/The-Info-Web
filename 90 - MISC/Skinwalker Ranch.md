[[Skinwalker Ranch]] is a 480-acre property in Utah known for a long history of paranormal and [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]]-related events. The ranch was a subject of investigation for the [[Advanced Aerospace Weapons System Applications Program]] (AAWSAP), the precursor to the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP).[^1]

### Phenomena and Investigation

The ranch has been the site of a wide range of anomalous activity, including UAP sightings, strange apparitions, and other terrifying experiences. Visitors have reported seeing a variety of UAP, from orbs to larger craft, and have experienced equipment malfunctions and other strange occurrences.[^1]

In the mid-1990s, the ranch was purchased by [[Robert Bigelow]], who established the [[National Institute for Discovery Science]] (NIDS) to study the phenomena. When AAWSAP was established with Bigelow's company, [[Bigelow Aerospace Advanced Space Studies]] (BAASS), as the primary contractor, the investigation of Skinwalker Ranch became a part of the program's portfolio. Teams of researchers were sent to the ranch to collect data on the anomalous activity.[^1]

One of the most disturbing phenomena associated with the ranch is the "hitchhiker effect," a term coined by [[Jay Stratton]]. This refers to the tendency for the paranormal phenomena to "follow" investigators home, harassing them and their families long after they have left the property. [[Luis Elizondo]] notes that his own experiences with orbs in his home began after he started working with the program, and that other members of the team had similar experiences.[^1]

### The Blue Orbs

One of the most dangerous phenomena reported at the ranch are the blue orbs. In one incident, two dogs owned by a rancher chased a blue orb into a field and were vaporized, leaving behind only grease spots on the sagebrush. The orbs are believed to emit a form of directed energy that can be harmful or even lethal to living tissue.[^1]

### Connection to AATIP

The investigation of Skinwalker Ranch was a controversial aspect of the AATIP program. While program leader [[Dr. James Lacatski]] believed that the paranormal events at the ranch were inextricably linked to the UAP mystery, the focus on such phenomena drew criticism from within the [[Pentagon]] and contributed to the internal opposition that ultimately led to the program losing its official support.[^1]
