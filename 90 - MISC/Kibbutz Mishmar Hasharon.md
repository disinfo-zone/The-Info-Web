[[Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon]] is a kibbutz in [[Israel]]. In 1969, [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] joined this kibbutz after he could not be drafted into the [[Israel|Israeli]] army due to his [[Iran|Iranian]] passport. While there, he studied Hebrew and performed volunteer work.[^1]

It was at [[Kibbutz Mishmar Hasharon]] that [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] met [[Michael Dennis Rohan]], an [[Australia|Australian]] member of the Church of God, and an [[USA|American]] Baptist named Arthur. [[Michael Dennis Rohan|Rohan]] later carried out an arson attack on the [[El Aqsa Mosque]], an event that [[Ari Ben-Menashe]] helped to expose.[^1]
