# PSI Research Programs
*These programs represent the direct efforts to study, develop, and apply psychic phenomena for intelligence and military purposes.*

- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/STARGATE PROJECT|STARGATE PROJECT]] - The umbrella designation for the U.S. government's psychic spying program, which investigated remote viewing and other psi abilities for over two decades.
- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/Project Deep Quest|Project Deep Quest]] - A unique psychic functioning experiment that used remote viewing to locate a previously unknown shipwreck, demonstrating the potential of psi in real-world applications.
- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/SCANATE|SCANATE]] - The original code name for the Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV) methodology, developed by Ingo Swann, which became a foundational technique for psychic intelligence.
- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/Great Skill Program|Great Skill Program]] - A U.S. Army program that explored human potential and psychic abilities, reportedly recruiting and training individuals for remote viewing.
- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/Paraphysics R&D - Warsaw Pact|Paraphysics R&D - Warsaw Pact]] - A 1977 report highlighting extensive Soviet research into electromagnetic fields, quantum physics, and psychokinesis, fueling U.S. concerns about a "psi gap."
- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR|Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR]] - A 1972 DIA report that warned of a "devastating 'psi gap'" with the Soviets, outlining their alleged advancements in psychic warfare and behavior control.
- [[PSI_RESEARCH_PROGRAMS/The Nautilus (Telepathy Project)|The Nautilus (Telepathy Project)]] - A fabricated story about successful telepathy experiments on a U.S. submarine that, despite being false, was believed by the Soviets and spurred their own extensive psi research.

# Intelligence Operations
*These programs represent specific intelligence-gathering or special operations efforts, some of which intersected with psychic capabilities.*

- [[INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS/Systems Exploitation Detachment|Systems Exploitation Detachment]] - An INSCOM unit involved in operations security and special projects, which housed the early Army remote viewing team.
- [[INTELLIGENCE_OPERATIONS/Project 8200|Project 8200]] - An Israeli intelligence unit, reportedly involved in advanced technological and psychic research, with connections to figures like Uri Geller.
- [[30 - PROGRAMS & PROJECTS/Tower Commission|Tower Commission]] - A presidential commission of inquiry established to investigate the Iran-Contra Affair, focusing on a limited scope of the events.

# Historical Programs
*Significant historical programs that provide context for the later development of psychic research and intelligence activities.*

- [[HISTORICAL_PROGRAMS/Project MKUltra|Project MKUltra]] - A notorious CIA program that explored mind control, chemical interrogation, and other unconventional methods, setting a precedent for ethically questionable research.
- [[HISTORICAL_PROGRAMS/Project Pandora|Project Pandora]] - A classified Pentagon program that aimed to duplicate the effects of the Moscow Signal, investigating the potential of microwave radiation as a weapon.

# Software Projects
*Key software development initiatives that became central to broader narratives of government, technology, and alleged conspiracy.*

- [[SOFTWARE_PROJECTS/PROMIS|PROMIS]] - A case-management software developed for the Department of Justice that became entangled in a complex web of conspiracy involving intelligence agencies and alleged backdoors.
