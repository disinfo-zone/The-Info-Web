[[Project 8200]] is a program related to UFO/UAP (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) bases and activities. It is mentioned in the context of [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]]'s publications, specifically his 2024 book *Project 8200: UFO/UAP Bases and Activities: The original Remote Viewing Transcripts* (ISBN-10 3911151047). This suggests a connection between remote viewing and the investigation of unexplained aerial phenomena, potentially involving the use of remote viewing to gather intelligence on such subjects.[^1]
