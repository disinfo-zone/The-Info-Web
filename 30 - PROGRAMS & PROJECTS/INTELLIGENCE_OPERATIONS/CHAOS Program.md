The CHAOS Program was a highly secret [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operation. It involved the Agency's purchase of a [[Washington D.C.]] trash collection company, which had contracts to pick up garbage at various Third World embassies, including the Israeli embassy. The trash was systematically sorted and analyzed for any possible intelligence. [[James Jesus Angleton]] was a sponsor of this program.[^1]
