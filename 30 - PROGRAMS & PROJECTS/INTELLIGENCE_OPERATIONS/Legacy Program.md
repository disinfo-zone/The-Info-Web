The [[Legacy Program]] is the name given to a deeply hidden, decades-long U.S. government and private contractor effort to retrieve and reverse-engineer technology from crashed or landed [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) of non-human origin. The existence of this program has been a central claim of numerous whistleblowers and a primary focus of recent congressional inquiry into the UAP topic.[^1]

### Alleged Activities and Secrecy

According to testimony from whistleblowers like [[David Grusch]] and documents like the [[Wilson-Davis Memo]], the Legacy Program has been in operation since at least the 1940s, following the [[Roswell Incident]]. The program is said to be in possession of multiple craft of non-human origin, as well as the "biologics" of their former occupants. These materials are allegedly held by a consortium of aerospace and defense contractors, who have been tasked with reverse-engineering the technology for military applications.[^1]

The program operates with a level of secrecy that is said to be far beyond that of even the most sensitive [[Special Access Programs]] (SAPs). It is alleged to be funded through a complex web of black budget appropriations and to be largely unaccountable to congressional oversight. The program has been accused of actively obstructing other government UAP investigations, including the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) and the [[UAP Task Force]].[^1]

### The Military-Industrial Complex

The Legacy Program is said to be deeply intertwined with the military-industrial complex. Major aerospace and defense contractors are alleged to be the primary custodians of the recovered UAP materials. This has raised concerns about the potential for these companies to profit from taxpayer-funded research and development that is conducted outside of any public or congressional oversight. The [[Wilson-Davis Memo]] details an incident where a senior admiral was threatened by a corporate contractor for attempting to gain access to the program, highlighting the immense power and influence of these private entities.[^1]

### Efforts at Oversight

Recent UAP disclosure legislation, including the UAP Disclosure Act of 2023, has been specifically designed to bring the Legacy Program under government oversight. The legislation includes provisions for a presidentially-appointed review board to declassify UAP records, as well as a whistleblower process that allows individuals with knowledge of the program to testify to Congress without fear of reprisal. The goal of this legislation is to bring the Legacy Program out of the shadows and to ensure that the U.S. government and the American people are finally made aware of the truth about the UAP phenomenon.[^1]
