The Systems Exploitation Detachment (SED) was a unit within the [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM) and the office of the assistant chief of staff for intelligence ([[ACSI]]). It was headed by Colonel [[Robert Keenan]] when the remote viewing program was initiated in 1977. [[Ed Dames]] considered the SED to be an elite unit of creative thinkers.

The SED played a crucial role in the establishment of the Army's remote viewing program. When [[Frederick Atwater]] proposed forming a remote viewing team, he presented the idea to Colonel Robert Keenan, who was in charge of the SED. Keenan approved Atwater's proposal, leading to the program's creation in 1977.
### Organizational Structure and Control

    *   United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) [i]
