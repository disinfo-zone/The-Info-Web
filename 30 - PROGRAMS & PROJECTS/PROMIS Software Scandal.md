The [[PROMIS Software Scandal]] centers around a revolutionary case management system called [[PROMIS]] (Prosecutor's Management Information System). Originally developed as "Old PROMIS" by the not-for-profit Institute For Law And Social Research ("the Institute") in 1973 with funding from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA), this initial version was in the public domain. Further enhancements, known as the five BJS enhancements, and a "Pilot Project" version were also developed with public funding and remained in the public domain.[1, 2]

In January 1981, [[Bill Hamilton]] organized [[Inslaw Corporation]] as a for-profit entity and acquired the Institute's assets. The core of the scandal involves a 1982 implementation contract between Inslaw and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) for installing PROMIS in U.S. Attorneys' offices. This contract specifically called for the public domain version of Pilot Project PROMIS plus the five BJS enhancements.[2]

According to [[Bill Hamilton]] and [[Nancy Hamilton]], the owners of Inslaw, a version of their PROMIS software was pirated and allegedly modified with a "back-door" that allowed the U.S. government to access intelligence data of foreign countries. This modified software was reportedly sold to various foreign governments, including [[Canada]] (specifically the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] and [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service|CSIS]]) and [[Israel]].[1]

Key figures involved in the scandal include [[Michael Riconosciuto]], a computer scientist who claimed to have installed the "back-door" in PROMIS. Riconosciuto made various claims, including personally meeting with [[Earl Brian]], receiving a copy of PROMIS from Brian, performing alterations to PROMIS for international sale, and being aware of entities to which altered PROMIS was distributed. However, investigations found inconsistencies in his accounts regarding who he received the software from and when and where he altered it. Both Brian and [[Peter Videnieks]], a Justice Department contract official implicated by Riconosciuto, categorically denied ever meeting Riconosciuto or each other, or being involved in the alleged activities. The investigation concluded that Riconosciuto was a "totally unreliable witness" and that his claims were fabricated, lacking credible corroboration.[2]

[[Earl Brian]] allegedly spearheaded the plan for worldwide use of the modified software. However, investigations found no credible evidence to support the allegation that members of the DOJ conspired with Earl Brian to obtain or distribute PROMIS software. The overwhelming weight of the evidence indicated no connection between Earl Brian and anything related to Inslaw or PROMIS software.[2]

[[Peter Videnieks]], a Justice Department contract official, was also implicated in making the software available. His involvement was denied by him and found to be without credible evidence by the investigation.[2]

Investigations into the PROMIS Software Scandal were conducted by various entities, including the [[United States Department of Justice|DOJ]], the [[United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]], [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]]. These investigations often encountered obstruction and led to the abrupt shutdown of probes when they connected to high-level organized crime, drugs, and money laundering.[1]

The scandal is deeply intertwined with other major events, such as the [[October Surprise]], the [[Iran-Contra Affair]], and allegations of government-sanctioned drug trafficking and money laundering. The software was believed to be capable of tracking money laundering and moving funds invisibly through international banking systems like [[CHIPS]] and [[SWIFT]].[1]
