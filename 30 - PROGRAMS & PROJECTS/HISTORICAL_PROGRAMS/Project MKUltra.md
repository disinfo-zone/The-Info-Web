[[Project MKUltra]] was a top-secret, illegal human experimentation program designed and undertaken by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. It involved the use of various methods, including drugs like LSD, hypnosis, and other psychological manipulation techniques, to develop mind-control capabilities. The program's dark history, particularly its controversial studies on servicemen in the 1950s and 1960s, led to strict regulations regarding "human use experimentation" in the military.[^1]

In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, the history of such experimentation meant that the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program, which involved human subjects in remote viewing, had to involve the informed consent of its participants and approval and oversight by the Army's human use review board. This was a direct consequence of the controversies surrounding programs like MKUltra.[^1]
