[[Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR]] was a 1972 [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] report that assessed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] research into [[Parapsychology|psi]] phenomena and its potential military applications. The report noted that "the major impetus behind the Soviet drive to harness the possible capabilities of telepathic communication, telekinetics, and bionics are said to come from the Soviet military and the [[KGB]]."[^1]

The report, with what was described as "almost comical blandness," outlined the potential horrors that could be inflicted on the U.S. if Soviet psi research advanced, including: knowing the contents of top-secret U.S. documents, troop movements, and military installations; molding the thoughts of key U.S. leaders at a distance; causing instant death of U.S. officials at a distance; and disabling U.S. military equipment, including spacecraft, remotely. It concluded that "Soviet knowledge in this field is superior to that of the West," suggesting a devastating "psi gap" in addition to the perceived missile gap.[^1]

This report, along with other intelligence, contributed to the U.S. intelligence community's increased interest in and funding of its own psi research, including the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]].[^1]
