[[SCANATE]] was an early [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] program that explored [[Psi|psychic]] phenomena, particularly [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]]. It was initiated in 1970 in response to growing concerns about Soviet [[Parapsychology|psi]] research. The name "Scanate" was also used by [[Ingo Swann]] to refer to his coordinate-based clairvoyance scheme, which later became known as [[Coordinate Remote Viewing|Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV)]].[^1]
