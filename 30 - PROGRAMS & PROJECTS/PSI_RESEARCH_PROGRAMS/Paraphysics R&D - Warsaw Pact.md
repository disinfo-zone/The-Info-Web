"[[Paraphysics R&D - Warsaw Pact]]" was a 1977 [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] report authored by [[Dale Graff]]. The report assessed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and Warsaw Pact research into [[Psi|psi]] phenomena, including electromagnetic fields, quantum physics, holography, and gravitation. Graff coined the term "paraphysics" to describe this field, aiming to pivot the nomenclature away from psychology towards physics to gain more traction within the [[Department of Defense|DoD]].[^1]

The report highlighted Soviet research in biophysics and psychic healing, Kirlian photographs, auras, and map dowsing, with particular attention to [[Psychokinesis]]. It summarized the activities of individuals whose abilities were of concern to the U.S. intelligence and military communities, citing the "[[Geller Effect]]" and the frog experiments of [[Ninel Kulagina]].[^1]

This report, along with the earlier "[[Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR]]" report, contributed to the U.S. intelligence community's increased interest in and funding of its own psi research, including the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]].[^1]
