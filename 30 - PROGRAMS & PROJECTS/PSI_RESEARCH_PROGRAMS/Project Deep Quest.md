[[Project Deep Quest]] was a unique psychic functioning experiment conducted in 1977, involving [[Remote Viewing]] to locate an underwater shipwreck from a submersible. It was a collaborative effort between [[Stephan Schwartz]], [[Hal Puthoff]], [[Dale Graff]], and psychics [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Hella Hammid]].[^1]

The project had two main elements: an unclassified one focused on locating a shipwreck, and a classified project for the [[U.S. Air Force]] to test long-distance remote viewing inside a submersible. For the unclassified part, Swann and Hammid used map dowsing techniques to identify potential shipwreck locations on a nautical chart of Catalina Island. The submersible *Taurus I* was then used to investigate the identified location.[^1]

The project successfully located a previously unidentified shipwreck, marking the first time psychics had located an underwater archaeological site from inside a submersible. The classified portion, designed to test remote viewing for emergency military scenarios, also yielded positive results, suggesting the potential for [[PSI-INT]] in operational contexts.[^1]
