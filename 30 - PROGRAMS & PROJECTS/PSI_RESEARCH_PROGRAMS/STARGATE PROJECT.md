description: The Stargate Project was a secret U.S. Army unit established in 1977, which investigated psychic phenomena like remote viewing for military and intelligence purposes. Operating under various code names including Gondola Wish and Grill Flame, it involved psychics who claimed successes in locating targets and detecting foreign surveillance until its declassification in 1995.

The [[STARGATE PROJECT]] was a secret [[U.S. Army]] unit established in 1977 at [[Fort Meade]], Maryland. Its purpose was to investigate [[Psi|psychic]] phenomena, particularly [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]], for military and intelligence applications. The project operated under various code names throughout its lifespan, including **Gondola Wish**, **Grill Flame**, **Center Lane**, **Sun Streak**, and **Scanate**. These names were used at different times and for different aspects of the project, but all fell under the umbrella of psychic research for military and intelligence purposes. The project sought to harness these abilities for intelligence gathering and military operations, eventually being declassified in 1995.

## Overview
[[Remote Viewing]] is the claimed ability to gather information about distant or unseen targets using extrasensory perception or other paranormal means. The Stargate Project sought to harness this ability for intelligence gathering and military operations.

## The Project
### Foundations
The program was initiated by [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]], who had heard rumors of extensive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Parapsychology|psi]] research and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s own involvement with [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. Atwater proposed to Colonel [[Robert Keenan]], then head of [[Systems Exploitation Detachment]] (SED), that they assemble a remote viewing team. This proposal was ultimately approved in 1977 by Major General [[Edmund Thompson]] and commanding officer Major [[Murray Watt|Murray “Scotty” Watt]], who were assigned with Atwater to lead the project. They were given a very small budget and initially operated from a room in building 4554 at [[Fort Meade]], later moving to buildings 2560 and 2561 on Llewellyn Street to escape noise and gain more space.

The team reached out to [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] for guidance on selecting psychics. The original six soldier psychics, later narrowed to three full-time members, were [[Mel Riley]], [[Joe McMoneagle]], [[Ken Bell]], [[Nancy Stern]], [[Fernand Gauvin]], and [[Hartleigh Trent]]. The project, thanks in part to its minuscule investment, had support from not only Major General Thompson, but also [[United States Army Intelligence and Security Command]] (INSCOM) commander [[William Rolya]], Army Chief of Staff [[Edward Meyer]], and Secretary of the Army [[Clifford Alexander]].

Initially codenamed **Gondola Wish**, the program began as an experimental, part-time unit. It faced early challenges, including being categorized as "[[Human Use Experimentation|human use experimentation]]," which required informed consent and oversight from the Army's human use review board. After initial promising results and high-level interest, the unit transitioned to an offensive psychic spying team, becoming known as **Grill Flame** in late 1978.

### Successes
- **Chinese Nuclear Device (1979)**: In late summer 1979, [[Mel Riley]] and [[Joe McMoneagle]] remote viewed a new Chinese nuclear device at Lop Nor. They successfully agreed on the rough design, describing an "hourglass on its side" shape, which was later confirmed to be a critical design element by [[U.S. Air Force]] officials. They also determined that the device allegedly did not successfully detonate, a fact later confirmed by other intelligence sources, explaining why U.S. intelligence had failed to detect a nuclear explosion at the test site.[^1]

- **Crashed U.S. Navy A-6 Aircraft (1979)**: [[Ken Bell]] was tasked with locating a crashed [[U.S. Navy]] A-6 aircraft. He accurately determined its general location, specifying it was a few hundred miles from [[Fort Meade]] on something called “bald.” The aircraft was later found in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia on a hill named “Bald Knob,” confirming Bell's remote viewing.[^1]

- **Soviet Embassy Surveillance Bug (1980)**: [[Joe McMoneagle]], tasked by the [[NSA]], successfully detected the location of a [[Soviet Union|USSR]] surveillance bug in a U.S. embassy. He accurately deduced the device’s position, the location of the soviet listening equipment across the street, and even perceived that an American team had detected the Russians and were counter-surveilling them. This demonstrated the program's ability to provide actionable intelligence.[^1]

- **Soviet T-72 Tank Acquisition**: Remote viewers, including [[Mel Riley]], [[Hartleigh Trent]], [[Ken Bell]], and [[Joe McMoneagle]], successfully tracked the acquisition of a Soviet T-72 tank by the U.S. government. McMoneagle even perceived a staged hijacking of the tank's transport ship, which was later confirmed to be a ruse to cover the general selling the tank.[^1]

- **B-2 Stealth Bomber (Opsec Tasking)**: In a highly sensitive opsec tasking, [[Mel Riley]] remote-viewed a "strange batlike flying-wing shape" with a "bulbous cockpit" and fiber-optic control mechanisms. Years later, this was identified as the then-secret B-2 Stealth bomber, demonstrating the program's ability to penetrate highly classified projects and provide details that were unknown even to the tasking Air Force officials.[^1]

- **KGB Agent Interrogation**: [[Ken Bell]] and [[Mel Riley]] successfully remote-viewed a [[KGB]] "illegal" in South Africa who was resisting interrogation. Bell's "telepathic interrogation" revealed details about the agent's family and a hidden pocket calculator, which helped the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] break an important counterintelligence case.[^1]

- **Soviet Typhoon-Class Submarine (1979)**: [[Joe McMoneagle]], known as "Viewer 518" to the [[National Security Council|NSC]], provided highly accurate details about a new Soviet Typhoon-class submarine under construction at Severodvinsk. He described its massive size, double hull, canted missile tubes, and unique welding techniques, even predicting the Soviets would dynamite a channel to launch it. This information was later confirmed by satellite imagery, sparking debate within the NSC about the value of remote viewing.[^1]

- **Skylab Crash Zone (1979)**: [[Joe McMoneagle]] accurately predicted the crash zone of Skylab, which reentered Earth's atmosphere over eastern Australia, blazing a trail westward and raining hot metal debris on western Australia and the Indian Ocean.[^1]

## Challenges and Controversies
- **Scientific Skepticism**: The project faced significant skepticism from the mainstream scientific community, who often dismissed psi research as pseudoscience or fraud. Despite statistically significant results, the lack of tangible, repeatable real-world applications made it difficult to gain widespread scientific acceptance. The "[[Giggle Factor]]" within intelligence agencies also reflected this skepticism, hindering the program's operational integration.[^1]

- **Human Use Experimentation Concerns**: Due to the controversial history of programs like [[Project MKUltra]], the Stargate Project was categorized as "[[Human Use Experimentation|human use experimentation]]." This required extensive informed consent and oversight, but also raised concerns about the psychological toll on remote viewers, who experienced mental fatigue, emotional fragility, and burnout from intense and monotonous taskings, particularly during the Iran hostage crisis.[^1]

- **Disinformation and Misinformation**: The field of psi research was often plagued by disinformation, such as the fabricated [[The Nautilus (Telepathy Project)|"Secret of the Nautilus"]] story, which, despite being false, significantly influenced Soviet psi research and contributed to the perception of a "[[Psi Gap|psi gap]]." This made it challenging to discern genuine psychic phenomena from hoaxes or deliberate deception.[^1]

- **Operational Limitations**: While remote viewers achieved notable successes, their abilities had limitations. They struggled with perceiving numbers and letters accurately, and their perceptions could be influenced by their own imagination or prior knowledge. The effectiveness of remote viewing was also dependent on the nature of the target, with fixed, visually dramatic targets being easier to perceive than moving or abstract ones.[^1]

- **Security Concerns**: The accuracy of remote viewing, as demonstrated by incidents like the Sugar Grove viewing, raised significant security concerns within the Pentagon, leading to investigations into potential information leaks. The extreme secrecy surrounding the program was partly to protect it from Soviet eyes, but also to shield its supporters from public "mortification and embarrassment."[^1]
