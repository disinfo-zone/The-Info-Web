A neutron bomb is a type of thermonuclear weapon that utilizes enhanced radiation and minimal blast to kill living organisms within a limited range, with limited damage to property. It is a two-stage thermonuclear device that uses tritium and deuterium to maximize the release of neutrons. These weapons first came into the American stockpile in the mid-1970s.[^1]

[[Mordecai Vanunu]]'s photographs provided evidence that [[Israel]] was capable of manufacturing one of the most sophisticated weapons in the nuclear arsenalâ€”a low-yield neutron bomb. The opening of Unit 93 at [[Dimona]] in 1984, a new facility for large-scale production of tritium, suggested that full-scale production of neutron weapons began then, as up to twenty grams of tritium are used in each neutron warhead.[^1]
