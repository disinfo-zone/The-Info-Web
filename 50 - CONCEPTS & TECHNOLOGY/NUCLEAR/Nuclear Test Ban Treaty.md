The Nuclear Test Ban Treaty refers to international agreements aimed at prohibiting nuclear weapons tests. By December 1960, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] had made steady progress in drafting a comprehensive treaty banning all nuclear tests, and such testing was suspended by both nations until September 1961. This success led to an overall heightened sensitivity about nuclear proliferation.[^1]
