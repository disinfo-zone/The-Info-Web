This Map of Content serves as a curated guide to the most significant concepts and technologies within The Info Web. It is not an exhaustive index, but a starting point for exploring the central themes of paranormal research, intelligence, and the esoteric technologies that define this hidden history.

# PSI Phenomena
*The core psychic abilities that were the subject of government research and espionage.*

- [[Remote Viewing]] - A structured psychic protocol developed at SRI, allowing a "viewer" to perceive a distant, unseen target, which became the cornerstone of the U.S. psychic spying program.
- [[Psychokinesis]] - The ability of the mind to influence physical matter without direct interaction, famously demonstrated by Uri Geller's metal-bending, which sparked major CIA and scientific interest.
- [[Telepathy]] - The direct transmission of thoughts or feelings from one mind to another, a capability explored for covert communication and interrogation.
- [[Precognition]] - The perception of future events, an ability that, while unreliable, occasionally produced startlingly accurate results in operational tests.
- [[Out-of-Body Experience]] - The sensation of one's consciousness leaving the physical body, a phenomenon reported by key psychics like Ingo Swann and Joe McMoneagle that informed their remote viewing abilities.

# Research Methodologies
*The specific techniques developed to harness psi and the primary obstacles faced by the researchers.*

- [[Coordinate Remote Viewing]] - The breakthrough protocol using geographic coordinates to target psychics, making remote viewing a viable intelligence-gathering tool.
- [[Analytical Overlay]] - The remote viewer's primary cognitive pitfall, where their own knowledge and biases distort raw psychic data.
- [[Psychotronic Research]] - The Eastern European term for psi research, focusing on the interaction between human psychology and electronics.

# Scientific Theories & Technologies
*Key scientific concepts and technologies used to test, measure, or explain psychic phenomena.*

- [[Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Waves]] - Electromagnetic waves hypothesized as a potential carrier for telepathic signals due to their ability to penetrate physical barriers.
- [[Faraday Cage]] - An enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields, which was a critical tool in early experiments to test the nature of ESP.
- [[The Nautilus]] - The world's first nuclear submarine, which became the subject of a fabricated telepathy story that spurred real Soviet research.

# Intelligence Tradecraft
*Terms and concepts specific to the world of espionage and the military application of psi.*

- [[Psi Gap]] - The Cold War fear that the Soviet Union had a significant lead in psychic research and weaponry, a primary driver for U.S. investment.
- [[Giggle Factor]] - The pervasive skepticism and fear of ridicule that constantly threatened the psychic programs' funding and legitimacy.
- [[Disinformation]] - The deliberate spread of false information, a key Cold War tactic that clouds the true history of psi research.
- [[PSI-INT]] - The formal intelligence designator for "psi-derived intelligence," placing it alongside traditional disciplines like HUMINT and SIGINT.
- [[Eight-Martini Results]] - A CIA term for psychic intelligence so accurate and unsettling that it drives intelligence officers to drink.

# Esoteric & Historical Concepts
*Related spiritual, psychological, and historical ideas that provide a broader context for the research.*

- [[Parapsychology]] - The formal, albeit controversial, scientific study of paranormal phenomena that provided the foundation for government research.
- [[THE PHENOMENON]] - The meta-concept of a long-standing interaction between humanity and a non-human intelligence, framing the modern UAP/psi story.
- [[The Nine Principles and Forces]] - A group of channeled entities that profoundly influenced the worldview of researcher Andrija Puharich.
- [[Synchronicity]] - A concept of meaningful coincidences, which influenced some key figures to be more open to the possibility of psi.

# Advanced Human Technology
*Technologies and techniques aimed at influencing or enhancing human performance and perception.*

- [[Psychotronic Weapons]] - A theoretical class of Soviet weapons designed to use electromagnetic radiation to influence human behavior.
- [[Synthetic Telepathy]] - A technology using microwaves to induce audible sounds inside a person's head, blurring the line between psi and tech.
- [[Human Potential]] - The belief in untapped human capabilities, which drove much of the military's interest in creating "super-soldiers."
- [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] - The Chinese government's term for psi abilities, which they studied as a new frontier of science.
- [[Mind Projection]] - A claimed psychic ability to influence or implant thoughts into another person's mind.
