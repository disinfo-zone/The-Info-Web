[[Glossolalia]], commonly known as "speaking in tongues," is the phenomenon of uttering words or sounds that resemble language but are not understood by the speaker or listeners. It is often associated with religious practices, spiritual experiences, or trance states, where it is sometimes described as divinely inspired speech.[^1]

In the context of [[Parapsychology]] and the study of mediums, glossolalia was a key aspect of the case of [[Hélène Smith]], a French medium studied by [[Théodore Flournoy]]. Smith claimed to speak in various languages, including an unidentifiable "Martian-speak," during her trance states. Flournoy, however, attributed this to glossolalia, suggesting it was a product of her subconscious rather than genuine communication with spirits or extraterrestrial beings. He believed that the brain was capable of astonishing feats, including the unconscious recall and reproduction of foreign languages heard only briefly, sometimes decades before.[^1]

Historically, glossolalia has been discussed in religious texts, such as the First Corinthians in the Bible, where Paul describes it as a form of communication directed only to God, as people would not be able to understand it. This concept highlights the intersection of psychological phenomena, religious belief, and the interpretation of unusual linguistic expressions.[^1]
