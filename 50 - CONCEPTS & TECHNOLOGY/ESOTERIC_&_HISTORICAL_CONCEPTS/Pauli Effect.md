The [[Pauli Effect]] is the anecdotal tendency of technical equipment to encounter critical failure in the presence of certain people. It is named after the Austrian theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, who was known for his uncanny ability to cause experimental equipment to malfunction simply by being in its vicinity.[^1]

In the context of psychic research, the Pauli effect is often cited as an example of [[Psychokinesis|psychokinesis]], or the ability of the mind to influence physical systems. The strange occurrences that happened around [[Uri Geller]], such as equipment malfunctioning and objects disappearing, were referred to as the "[[Geller Effect]]," a modern-day extension of the Pauli effect.[^1]
