The "[[Geller Effect]]" refers to the phenomenon where individuals, particularly children and teenagers, reportedly become able to bend metal or influence electronic devices after witnessing [[Uri Geller]] perform such feats. This secondary effect of Geller's demonstrations was of interest to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences, as it suggested a potential for widespread psychokinetic influence.[^1]

The Geller effect is an example of how the perception of a paranormal event can have real-world consequences, regardless of whether the initial event was genuine or the result of trickery. It highlights the power of belief and suggestion in the realm of psychic phenomena.[^1]
