"[[The Nine Principles and Forces]]" was the name given to a group of entities that the Hindu mystic [[Dr. D. G. Vinod]] allegedly channeled during a séance at [[Andrija Puharich]]'s [[Round Table Foundation]] on New Year's Eve, 1952.[^1]

According to Puharich, Vinod, in a deep trance, spoke in a sonorous voice, discussing a wide array of mystical concepts, from [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]] to teleportation and alchemy. The entities also referred to Einstein, Jesus, atomic weapons, and cosmic rays. This experience was a turning point for Puharich, convincing him that the energy force behind psychic phenomena was an external, possibly extraterrestrial, intelligence.[^1]
