[[Synchronicity]] is a concept first introduced by the Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]]. It refers to meaningful coincidences that lack a causal relationship but are deeply connected in meaning. Jung believed that synchronicity was an acausal connecting principle, a phenomenon where events in the external world mirror an individual's internal psychological state, suggesting a deeper, underlying order to the universe.[^1]

In the context of the *Phenomena* text, synchronicity is mentioned in relation to [[Arthur Koestler]]'s book *The Roots of Coincidence*, which explored Jung's concepts and their potential connection to [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]]. Major General [[Edmund Thompson]], a key supporter of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], developed an interest in psi phenomena after reading Koestler's book, suggesting that the idea of meaningful coincidences played a role in his openness to psychic research.[^1]

Synchronicity differs from mere coincidence in that it carries a profound personal meaning for the individual experiencing it, often feeling like a sign or a message. It suggests a connection between the inner and outer worlds that goes beyond conventional cause and effect, hinting at a collective unconscious or a universal field of information.[^1]
