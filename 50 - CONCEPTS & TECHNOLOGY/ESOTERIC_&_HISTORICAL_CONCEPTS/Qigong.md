[[Qigong]] is a traditional Chinese practice of coordinated body posture and movement, breathing, and meditation used for health, spirituality, and martial arts training. It is based on the concept of [[qi]], or vital energy, which is believed to flow through the body.[^1]

In the context of psychic research, qigong gained prominence in [[China]] during the "Extraordinary Powers Craze" of the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was believed that the practice of qigong could enhance or unlock [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF), including [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]]. The Chinese government, under the influence of [[Qian Xuesen]], officially sanctioned research into qigong and its potential applications.[^1]
