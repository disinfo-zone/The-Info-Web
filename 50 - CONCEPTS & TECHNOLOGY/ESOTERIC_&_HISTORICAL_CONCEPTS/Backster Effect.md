The [[Backster Effect]] is a controversial theory proposed by [[Cleve Backster]], a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] polygraph expert. It suggests that plants exhibit a form of consciousness and can respond to human thoughts and emotions, as well as to events occurring in their environment, even at a distance.[^1]

Backster's experiments involved attaching polygraph electrodes to plants and observing their responses to various stimuli, such as the intention to harm them. He claimed that the plants showed measurable reactions, which he interpreted as evidence of a "primary perception" in plant life. While widely criticized by mainstream scientists for lacking scientific rigor and repeatability, the concept gained popular attention through the bestselling book *The Secret Life of Plants*.[^1]
