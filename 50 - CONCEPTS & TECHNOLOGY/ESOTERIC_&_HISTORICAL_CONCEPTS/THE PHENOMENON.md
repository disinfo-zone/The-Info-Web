### Editor’s Note

The phenomenon is a multi-thousand year old interaction between humanity and [[non human intelligence]]. Over this period, it has been discussed under a variety of names such as gods, angels, demons, spirits, various folklore creatures, flying ships, and most recently UFO’s, UAP’s, and USO’s (a very non exhaustive list).

The focus of this info web is the 20th and 21st century intersection between government [[UAP]] coverups and our increasing sensor and information technological abilities.

This project is not exhaustive and does not pretend to be, it is a work in progress and will always be incomplete. It tries to follow threads and explore verifiable information. It does so by digging into texts and the people, organizations, and events chronicled within. It is oriented from a perspective that this phenomenon is real, that it exists both in a physical nuts and bolts way as well as in a domain beyond our current understanding.
