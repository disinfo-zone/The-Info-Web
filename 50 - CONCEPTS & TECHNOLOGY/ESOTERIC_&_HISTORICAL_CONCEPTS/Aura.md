An [[Aura]] is a supposed emanation of energy or light surrounding a person or object, believed by some to be a manifestation of their life force or spiritual essence. The concept of auras is often associated with spiritual and metaphysical traditions, and has been explored in the context of [[Parapsychology]].[^1]

[[Kirlian Photography]] was believed by some to be able to capture images of auras, suggesting a physical manifestation of this energy. [[Dale Graff]]'s 1977 report, "[[Paraphysics R&D - Warsaw Pact]]," discussed Soviet research into auras as part of their broader investigation into paranormal phenomena.[^1]
