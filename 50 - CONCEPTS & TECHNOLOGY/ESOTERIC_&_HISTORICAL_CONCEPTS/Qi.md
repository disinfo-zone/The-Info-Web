[[Qi]], also known as chi, is a fundamental concept in traditional Chinese culture, referring to the vital life force that flows through all living things. It is a central principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts.[^1]

In the context of psychic research, the concept of qi is closely linked to the practice of [[qigong]] and the belief in [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF). It is believed that by cultivating and mastering the flow of qi, individuals can unlock paranormal abilities such as [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]].[^1]
