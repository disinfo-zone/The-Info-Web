The USS Nautilus (SSN-571) was the world's first operational nuclear-powered submarine, launched by the United States in 1954. It gained notoriety in the context of psychic research due to a fabricated story published in 1960.[^1]

In February 1960, the French magazine *Science et Vie* published an article titled "The Secret of the Nautilus," written by [[Gerard Messadi√©]] and allegedly sourced by [[Jacques Bergier]]. The article falsely claimed that the U.S. government had successfully used telepathy to communicate with the Nautilus crew while the submarine was submerged beneath the Arctic ice cap.[^1]

Despite official American denials, the Soviet Union reportedly believed the story, which served as a significant stimulus for the expansion of their own parapsychology research programs. The Soviets even claimed to have replicated the entire Nautilus experiment successfully with one of their own submarines.[^1]
