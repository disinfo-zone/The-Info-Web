[[Associative Remote Viewing]] (ARV) is a precognitive [[Remote Viewing]] technique where objects or geographic locations are used as surrogates for abstract data, such as numbers or letters, which are generally difficult to remote-view directly. The idea is that the remote viewer precognizes their own future perception of an object, rather than directly perceiving the abstract data itself.[^1]

In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] experimented with ARV, attempting to use it to predict Maryland lottery numbers. In these informal experiments, objects were assigned to numbers, and remote viewers would describe the objects they would be presented with on a future date, corresponding to the winning lottery numbers. However, these attempts were unsuccessful. ARV was also used in treasure hunt schemes, where remote viewers would try to narrow down search areas by associating impressions with locations on a map.[^1]
