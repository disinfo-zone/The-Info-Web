[[Outbound Remote Viewing]] is a [[Remote Viewing]] methodology where an "outbound" experimenter visits a target site while the psychic, typically back at a laboratory, attempts to perceive and describe the experimenter's surroundings. This method allows for richer feedback, as the psychic can later visit the actual site to compare their impressions with reality.[^1]

This protocol was used in early remote viewing experiments at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]]. For example, [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Earle Jones]] served as outbound experimenters for [[Pat Price]], who accurately described their location at Hoover Tower. Similarly, [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] used this method in early sessions with [[Mel Riley]] at [[Fort Meade]]. The technique was also employed in experiments with [[Hella Hammid]], where she demonstrated precognitive abilities by accurately describing a site even before it was randomly selected for the outbound experimenter.[^1]
