[[Psychotronic Research]] was the Eastern European pseudo-technical term for [[Psi|psi]] research, particularly focusing on the interaction between human psychology and electronics. In 1973, [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Ingo Swann]] traveled to Prague for the First International Conference on Psychotronic Research. At this conference, Soviet and Eastern European psi researchers were particularly interested in how [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] managed to keep its psychic subjects mentally stable, suggesting that some of their own subjects had begun to experience serious problems.[^1]

This field of research was part of the broader Soviet and Eastern European efforts in [[Parapsychology|parapsychology]], which contributed to concerns within the U.S. intelligence community about a potential "[[Psi Gap|psi gap]]."[^1]
