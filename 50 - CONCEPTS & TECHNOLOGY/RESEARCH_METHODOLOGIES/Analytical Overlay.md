[[Analytical Overlay]] refers to the conscious or unconscious imposition of a remote viewer's existing knowledge, beliefs, or biases onto their psychic perceptions, potentially distorting the accuracy of the data. It is a significant challenge in [[Remote Viewing]] and other [[ESP]] phenomena, as the mind naturally tries to make sense of incoming information by fitting it into familiar frameworks.[^1]

In the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], protocols were developed to minimize analytical overlay, such as using "blind" tasking where the remote viewer had no prior knowledge of the target. However, it remained a persistent issue, as seen in the search for General Dozier, where the volume of vague and disparate information from remote viewers made it difficult to separate signal from noise. [[Dale Graff]] worked to cull this information and narrow search parameters, recognizing the impact of analytical overlay on the data.[^1]
