The [[Outbounder-Beacon Experiment]] was a [[Remote Viewing]] protocol developed by [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] for the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s psychic research program. In this experiment, two scientists or researchers, designated as the "outbounder team," would travel to a randomly selected target site. At a predetermined time, one of them would mentally survey the site, acting as a "beacon" for the psychic back at SRI.[^1]

The psychic, typically in a [[Faraday Cage]], would then attempt to perceive and sketch what the outbounder was seeing and sending telepathically. This method allowed for richer feedback, as the psychic's impressions could be directly compared to the actual target site. The outbounder-beacon experiment was a key component in the early stages of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]] and was used to test psychics like [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Pat Price]].[^1]
