[[Extended Remote Viewing]] (ERV) refers to deeper altered-state methods of [[Remote Viewing]], often favored by the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]] unit at [[Fort Meade]]. This methodology involves the remote viewer entering a profound trance-like state to perceive information about a distant or unseen target. Unlike [[Coordinate Remote Viewing|Coordinate Remote Viewing]] (CRV), which often involves more structured protocols, ERV emphasizes a deeper immersion into the psychic experience.[^1]

[[Mel Riley]] was known for his ability to enter a deep, trancelike state during remote viewing sessions, which aligns with the characteristics of ERV. The unit's move to quieter buildings at Fort Meade (2560 and 2561) was partly to facilitate these deeper states, as remote viewers in trance were highly sensitive to sounds.[^1]
