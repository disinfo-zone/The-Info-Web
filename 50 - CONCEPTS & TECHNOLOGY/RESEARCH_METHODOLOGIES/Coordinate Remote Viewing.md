[[Coordinate Remote Viewing]] (CRV) is a specific methodology of [[Remote Viewing]] that uses geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to direct a psychic's perception to a target. This technique was proposed by [[Ingo Swann]] to [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] in April 1973. Swann believed that using coordinates would allow psychics to be directed to a target precisely and economically, without actually being told what the target was, thus preventing conscious imagination from interfering with the psychic impressions.[^1]

Initially, Puthoff and Targ were skeptical of the idea, arguing that coordinate systems were arbitrary human creations and that a psychic's success might be attributed to eidetic memory or cryptomnesia. However, Swann persisted, and after informal tests showed promising results, the protocol was tightened, with coordinates being selected by a third party unknown to the researchers and the psychic. The accuracy of CRV was famously demonstrated in the Sugar Grove incident, where Swann and [[Pat Price]] accurately described a secret [[NSA]] facility despite being given coordinates for a different location.[^1]

CRV became a fundamental technique within the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]] (also known as [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]]), allowing for the operational application of remote viewing for intelligence gathering. It was distinguished from other methodologies like Outbound Remote Viewing and Extended Remote Viewing.[^1]
