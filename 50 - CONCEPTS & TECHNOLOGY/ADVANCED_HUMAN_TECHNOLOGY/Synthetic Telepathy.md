[[Synthetic Telepathy]], also known as the [[Frey Effect]], is a technology discovered by [[Allan H. Frey]] in 1961. It involves using microwave input signals to allow the brain to receive messages that are perceived as voice transmissions, without any auditory input. This phenomenon suggests a direct interaction between electromagnetic energy and the human nervous system.[^1]

Frey's research demonstrated that living organisms are complex electrochemical systems that can be influenced by electromagnetic energy. He showed that by synchronizing the pulse rate of a microwave beam with a frog's heart, he could speed up, slow down, or even stop the heart. This raised concerns about the potential for [[Psychotronic Weapons]] to affect human physiology and behavior.[^1]
