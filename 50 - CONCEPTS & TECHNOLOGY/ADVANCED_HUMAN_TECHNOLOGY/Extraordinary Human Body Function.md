[[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF) is a term used in [[China]] to describe a range of paranormal abilities, including [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]]. The term gained prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s during the "Extraordinary Powers Craze," which was sparked by reports of a young boy named Tang Yu who could allegedly read with his ears.[^1]

The Chinese government, under the influence of the scientist [[Qian Xuesen]], officially sanctioned research into EHBF, viewing it as a new frontier of science with potential military applications. This led to the establishment of numerous research institutes and a surge in the study of [[qigong]] and other practices believed to enhance these abilities.[^1]
