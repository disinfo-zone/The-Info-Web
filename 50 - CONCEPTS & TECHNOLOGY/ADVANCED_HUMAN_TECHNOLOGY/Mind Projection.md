[[Mind Projection]] is a claimed [[Psi|psychic]] ability where an individual can influence or implant thoughts into another person's mind. In the context of the *Phenomena* text, [[Uri Geller]] was believed by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] analysts to possess this unique ability, whereby he could "force" researchers to name a city he had previously written down with a high degree of accuracy.[^1]

This concept raised national security concerns for the CIA, as the ability to influence a person's thoughts could potentially be used to manipulate their actions. The CIA implemented stricter controls during Geller's experiments to guard against any potential trickery or external influence, including strip-downs and X-rays.[^1]
