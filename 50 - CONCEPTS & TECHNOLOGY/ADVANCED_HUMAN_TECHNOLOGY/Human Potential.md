[[Human Potential]] refers to the inherent capabilities and untapped resources believed to exist within all individuals. This concept gained prominence in American counterculture since the early 1960s, with programs like EST (Erhard Seminars Training) and other practices ranging from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) to information-coded biofeedback.[^1]

In the context of psychic research, the idea of human potential was explored as a possible explanation for [[Psi|psychic]] abilities. The belief was that [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]] might be latent in all people and could be brought out through specific training and practices. This concept was particularly influential in the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], where the Army sought to train its own personnel in [[Remote Viewing]], believing that these abilities could be developed rather than being innate.[^1]

The Chinese government's interest in [[Extraordinary Human Body Function]] (EHBF) also aligns with the concept of human potential, as they viewed these abilities as biological functions that could be cultivated through practices like [[qigong]]. The U.S. military's interest in human potential was stimulated by the perceived threat from the Chinese, leading to efforts to advance human potential as a means of gaining superiority over the enemy.[^1]
