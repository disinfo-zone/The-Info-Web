[[Precognition]] is the claimed [[Psi|psychic]] ability to perceive or predict future events. It is a form of [[Psi|psi]] ability and a subject of study within [[Parapsychology]]. While the future is often described as opaque and confused in remote viewing, there were instances where precognition appeared to work with remarkable accuracy.[^1]

In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], precognition was explored through various means, including [[Associative Remote Viewing|Associative Remote Viewing]] (ARV), where remote viewers would attempt to precognize future events by describing associated objects. [[Pat Price]] famously demonstrated precognitive abilities by predicting the ceasefire date of the Yom Kippur War and accurately describing the Rinconada Park water tanks, which had existed in the past but were not present at the time of his viewing. [[Hella Hammid]] also showed strong precognitive talents, accurately describing targets even before they were randomly selected.[^1]

However, the book also highlights the challenges of precognition, noting that "time was the slipperiest dimension." Remote viewers sometimes found themselves in the past even when tasked with the present, and attempts to predict complex future events, such as the outcome of the U.S. Embassy construction in Moscow, often resulted in confused or inaccurate data, suggesting that the future is not always fixed or easily perceived.[^1]
