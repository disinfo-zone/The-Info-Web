[[Temporal Displacement]] in [[Remote Viewing]] refers to the phenomenon where a psychic perceives a target in a different time period (past or future) than the present moment. This can manifest as a remote viewer describing a location as it existed years ago, or even as it might exist in the future ([[Precognition]]).[^1]

[[Pat Price]] demonstrated temporal displacement during a remote viewing session of a North African embassy, where he described the building as a dormitory or hospital from an earlier time period, without a large iron gate that existed in the present. This phenomenon highlights the complex and often unpredictable nature of psychic perception, where the boundaries of time can appear fluid.[^1]
