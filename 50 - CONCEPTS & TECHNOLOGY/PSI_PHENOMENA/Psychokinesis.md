[[Psychokinesis]] (PK), also known as telekinesis, is a claimed [[Psi|psychic]] ability allowing a person to influence a physical system without physical interaction. This can include phenomena such as bending metal, moving objects, or affecting electronic equipment with the mind. PK is one of the core phenomena studied within [[Parapsychology]].[^1]

In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, PK was a subject of intense interest, particularly in relation to [[Uri Geller]]'s demonstrations of metal bending and his apparent ability to scramble electronic equipment. While Geller's psychokinetic displays often occurred under less controlled conditions, leading to suspicions of sleight of hand, his feats spurred scientific investigation into the phenomenon at institutions like [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].[^1]

Experiments were conducted to test PK, including attempts to affect magnetometers, clock pendulums, and even laser beams. The 1972 [[Controlled Offensive Behavior - USSR]] report highlighted Soviet interest in telekinetics as a potential military application. Despite the challenges in scientifically proving PK, its potential implications for military and intelligence applications, such as influencing enemy equipment, made it a subject of continued, albeit controversial, research.[^1]
