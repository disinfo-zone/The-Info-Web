[[Remote Viewing]] is a claimed [[Parapsychology|psychic]] ability to perceive information about a distant or unseen target, often used for intelligence gathering. The term was coined by [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] to describe a new, more scientific and sober approach to clairvoyance, distinguishing it from older, more sensationalized terms like ESP or psychic perception. It was the central focus of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], a U.S. government-sponsored program investigating psychic phenomena for military and intelligence applications.[^1]

## Methodologies and Techniques

Remote viewing encompasses various methodologies and techniques:

*   [[Coordinate Remote Viewing|Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV)]]: Developed by [[Ingo Swann]], this method involves using geographical coordinates to precisely and economically direct a psychic's perception to a target without revealing its identity. This was a breakthrough in making remote viewing operationally viable.[^1]

*   [[Outbound Remote Viewing|Outbound Remote Viewing]]: In this method, an "outbound" experimenter visits a target site while the psychic, back at the laboratory, attempts to visualize the experimenter's surroundings. This allows for richer feedback, as the psychic can later visit the site themselves.[^1]

*   [[Extended Remote Viewing|Extended Remote Viewing (ERV)]]: This refers to deeper altered-state methods of psychic spying, often favored by the unit at [[Fort Meade]].[^1]

*   [[Associative Remote Viewing|Associative Remote Viewing (ARV)]]: A technique used for [[Precognition|precognition]], where objects or geographic locations are used as surrogates for numbers or other abstract data that are difficult to remote-view directly. For example, a teddy bear might represent a specific number in a lottery, and the remote viewer would describe the teddy bear to predict the number.[^1]

## Characteristics and Limitations

Remote viewing, like any human faculty, has limitations. Numbers and letters are generally difficult to remote-view accurately. Visually dramatic targets with fixed and long-established locations are usually easier to perceive. The longer a target has existed at a given site, the easier it is to remote-view. Conversely, the more a target moves, the more it blurs in the remote viewer's perception. Remote viewers often find it difficult to describe a target's surroundings in enough detail to pinpoint its exact location, and reading signs or specific alphanumeric data is challenging.[^1]

## Aftereffects and Challenges

Intense remote viewing sessions can have aftereffects similar to those of hallucinogenic drugs, including heightened sensory perception and a feeling of a "natural high." However, prolonged and monotonous tasking can lead to mental fatigue, emotional fragility, and burnout. The controversial nature of remote viewing also led to the "[[Giggle Factor|giggle factor]]" within intelligence communities, where skepticism and fear of ridicule often hindered its acceptance and utilization.[^1]
