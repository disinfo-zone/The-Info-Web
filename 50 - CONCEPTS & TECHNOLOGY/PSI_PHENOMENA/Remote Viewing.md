description: Remote viewing is a claimed psychic ability to perceive information about a distant or unseen target, often used for intelligence gathering.
---

[[Remote Viewing]] is a controversial mental faculty or technique in which an individual is said to be able to acquire information about a distant or unseen target using extrasensory perception (ESP) or "sensing with the mind." The term was coined by [[Hal Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]] to describe a new, more scientific and sober approach to clairvoyance, distinguishing it from older, more sensationalized terms like ESP or psychic perception. It was the central focus of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], a U.S. government-sponsored program investigating psychic phenomena for military and intelligence applications.[^1]

Practitioners of remote viewing, known as remote viewers, are trained to enter a state of deep relaxation and focus their attention on a specific target, which can be a person, place, or object. The viewer then reports the images, feelings, thoughts, and other sensory impressions that come to them, a process that requires the suspension of analytical judgment. The key to the technique is to avoid what is known as "analytical overlay" (AO), the brain's natural tendency to interpret and categorize incoming data based on past experience. A successful remote viewer must act as a pure conduit for information, free of preconceived notions.[^2]

## Methodologies and Techniques

Remote viewing encompasses various methodologies and techniques:

*   [[Coordinate Remote Viewing|Coordinate Remote Viewing (CRV)]]: Developed by [[Ingo Swann]], this method involves using geographical coordinates to precisely and economically direct a psychic's perception to a target without revealing its identity. This was a breakthrough in making remote viewing operationally viable.[^1]

*   [[Outbound Remote Viewing|Outbound Remote Viewing]]: In this method, an "outbound" experimenter visits a target site while the psychic, back at the laboratory, attempts to visualize the experimenter's surroundings. This allows for richer feedback, as the psychic can later visit the site themselves.[^1]

*   [[Extended Remote Viewing|Extended Remote Viewing (ERV)]]: This refers to deeper altered-state methods of psychic spying, often favored by the unit at [[Fort Meade]].[^1]

*   [[Associative Remote Viewing|Associative Remote Viewing (ARV)]]: A technique used for [[Precognition|precognition]], where objects or geographic locations are used as surrogates for numbers or other abstract data that are difficult to remote-view directly. For example, a teddy bear might represent a specific number in a lottery, and the remote viewer would describe the teddy bear to predict the number.[^1]

## Characteristics and Limitations

Remote viewing, like any human faculty, has limitations. Numbers and letters are generally difficult to remote-view accurately. Visually dramatic targets with fixed and long-established locations are usually easier to perceive. The longer a target has existed at a given site, the easier it is to remote-view. Conversely, the more a target moves, the more it blurs in the remote viewer's perception. Remote viewers often find it difficult to describe a target's surroundings in enough detail to pinpoint its exact location, and reading signs or specific alphanumeric data is challenging.[^1]

## Aftereffects and Challenges

Intense remote viewing sessions can have aftereffects similar to those of hallucinogenic drugs, including heightened sensory perception and a feeling of a "natural high." However, prolonged and monotonous tasking can lead to mental fatigue, emotional fragility, and burnout. The controversial nature of remote viewing also led to the "[[Giggle Factor|giggle factor]]" within intelligence communities, where skepticism and fear of ridicule often hindered its acceptance and utilization.[^1]

## Connection to UAP and Consciousness

The study of remote viewing has led to speculation about its connection to the [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena|UAP]] phenomenon and the nature of consciousness itself. Some researchers, like [[Dr. Garry Nolan]], have discovered a correlation between individuals with a high aptitude for remote viewing and a hyperdeveloped area of the brain known as the caudate-putamen. This has led to the theory that this part of the brain may act as an "antenna," allowing certain individuals to perceive information that is normally filtered out by the conscious mind.[^2]

Furthermore, the apparent precognitive abilities of UAP, such as the [[Tic Tac]] seeming to know the future location of the F/A-18 pilots, have led some to speculate that the operators of these craft may possess highly evolved psychic abilities, or that consciousness itself may be a fundamental component of their propulsion systems. The idea that remote viewing may be a vestigial human ability, a form of pre-linguistic communication, has also been proposed.[^2]
