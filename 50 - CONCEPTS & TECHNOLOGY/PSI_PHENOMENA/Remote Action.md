[[Remote Action]] (RA) is a term used in [[Parapsychology]] to describe the influence of a person's mind on a physical system without direct interaction. It is a broader term for [[Psychokinesis]] (PK) and was used in the context of the U.S. government's psychic research programs to describe the potential for individuals to affect physical objects or systems from a distance.[^1]

The term was often used in conjunction with [[Remote Perturbation]] (RP), which refers to the specific act of disturbing or altering a physical system through mental influence.[^1]
