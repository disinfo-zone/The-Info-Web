[[Eyeless Sight]] is a claimed [[Psi|psychic]] ability to perceive visual information without the use of the eyes. It is a form of [[Clairvoyance]] and was demonstrated by [[Uri Geller]] in his stage performances, where he would, while blindfolded, accurately describe three-digit numbers or capital cities written on a blackboard.[^1]

In [[China]], during the [[Extraordinary Powers Craze]], children were reported to possess similar abilities, being able to read with their fingers, hands, and feet. Chinese air force scientists even proposed that the children's minds could produce "rays similar to microwaves" that enabled this form of perception.[^1]
