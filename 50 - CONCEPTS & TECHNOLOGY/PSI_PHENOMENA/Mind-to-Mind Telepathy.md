[[Mind-to-Mind Telepathy]] refers to the direct mental communication of thoughts, feelings, or ideas between individuals without the use of conventional sensory channels. It is a form of [[Telepathy]] and a subject of study within [[Parapsychology]].[^1]

In the context of the *Phenomena* text, [[Edgar Mitchell]], the Apollo 14 astronaut, conducted a secret mind-to-mind telepathy experiment during his Moon voyage. He acted as the sender, while a Swedish-born psychic named Olaf Johnson served as the receiver on Earth. This experiment, though its results were statistically close to chance, highlights the interest in exploring telepathy for long-distance communication, even in extreme environments like space.[^1]
