An [[Out-of-Body Experience]] (OBE) is a sensation of consciousness leaving the physical body. It is a phenomenon often reported by individuals with [[Psi|psychic]] abilities or those undergoing [[Near-Death Experience|near-death experiences]]. OBEs are a subject of study within [[Parapsychology]].[^1]

In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, several key figures reported experiencing OBEs:

*   [[Frederick Atwater|Skip Atwater]] had out-of-body experiences as a teenager, sometimes using this ability to "float" to distant locations, which contributed to his interest in the paranormal.[^1]

*   [[Ingo Swann]] claimed to have OBEs and even used them to view objects hidden in a laboratory, which was one of the feats that brought him to the attention of [[Hal Puthoff]] at [[Stanford Research Institute|SRI]].[^1]

*   [[Pat Price]] also had OBEs, which he claimed to use for psychic spying, drifting around the globe at night to perceive events. His ability to perform "Scanex" (scanning-extended) remote viewing, an eyes-closed altered-state form of psychic spying, is related to OBEs.[^1]

*   [[Joe McMoneagle]] experienced a profound OBE during his [[Near-Death Experience|near-death experience]] in 1970, where he found himself standing upright, looking down at his physical, dying body. This experience significantly enhanced his psychic abilities.[^1]
