*[[Taurus I]]* was a state-of-the-art, five-man submersible capable of traveling to a depth of 1,000 feet. It was 31 feet long and cost $3 million to build. It featured a large viewport and a claw to retrieve items from the ocean floor.[^1]

In 1977, *Taurus I* was used in [[Project Deep Quest]], a psychic functioning experiment led by [[Stephan Schwartz]]. The submersible was used to investigate a location identified by psychics [[Ingo Swann]] and [[Hella Hammid]] as a potential shipwreck site. The project successfully located a previously unidentified shipwreck, with *Taurus I* pulling up several pieces of the wreck.[^1]
