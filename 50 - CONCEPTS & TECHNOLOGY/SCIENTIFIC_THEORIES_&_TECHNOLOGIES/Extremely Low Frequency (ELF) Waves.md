[[Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Waves]] are electromagnetic waves with frequencies between 3 and 300 Hz. They are known for their ability to penetrate water and earth, making them useful for communication with deeply submerged submarines.[^1]

In the context of [[Parapsychology]], ELF waves were hypothesized as a possible carrier for [[ESP]] and [[Telepathy]]. [[Andrija Puharich]] and Jack Hammond conducted experiments using a [[Faraday Cage]] to test this theory, as Faraday cages do not block ELF waves. The idea was that if psychic abilities were not degraded inside the cage, it might suggest a connection to ELF waves.[^1]

The [[U.S. Navy]] also invested significantly in ELF research for submarine communication. The alleged Soviet "rabbit experiment," where a mother rabbit's brain activity was said to correlate with the death of her kits on a submerged submarine, further fueled speculation about ELF waves as a medium for psychic information transfer.[^1]
