[[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) is the official designation used by the U.S. government to refer to objects or phenomena in the atmosphere, in space, or underwater that cannot be immediately identified. The term has largely replaced the more colloquial term "Unidentified Flying Object" (UFO) in official government and military discourse.[^1]

### Characteristics and The Five Observables

UAP are characterized by their ability to perform maneuvers that are far beyond the capabilities of any known aircraft or technology. The [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) identified five key performance characteristics, known as [[The Five Observables]], that are commonly associated with UAP encounters: hypersonic velocity, instantaneous acceleration, low observability, transmedium travel, and antigravity. A sixth observable, biological effects on human witnesses, has also been noted.[^1]

### National Security Implications

The UAP issue has been increasingly recognized as a serious national security concern. The repeated incursions of UAP into sensitive military airspace, their apparent interest in nuclear facilities and capabilities, and their ability to outperform the most advanced U.S. military aircraft have raised alarms within the [[Pentagon]] and Congress. The potential for a technological surprise from a foreign adversary, or the existence of a non-human intelligence with unknown intentions, has driven the recent legislative efforts to increase transparency and oversight of the UAP issue.[^1]

### Government Investigation

The U.S. government has a long and secret history of investigating UAP, dating back to at least the [[Roswell Incident]] in 1947. This has included programs such as [[Project Blue Book]], the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP), the [[UAP Task Force]], and the current [[All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office]] (AARO). However, these efforts have been hampered by a culture of secrecy, stigma, and internal opposition.[^1]
