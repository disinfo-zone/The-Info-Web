[[The Five Observables]] are a set of key performance characteristics identified by the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP) to categorize and analyze the behavior of [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP). These observables represent capabilities that are far beyond any known conventional aircraft or technology.[^1]

### The Observables

The five observables are as follows:

**Hypersonic Velocity:** UAP have been observed traveling at speeds far in excess of Mach 5 (five times the speed of sound), often at low altitudes where such speeds would be impossible for conventional aircraft due to atmospheric friction. They do this without producing the sonic booms or heat signatures typically associated with hypersonic flight.[^1]

**Instantaneous Acceleration:** UAP can accelerate and change direction almost instantaneously, performing maneuvers that would subject any known craft to thousands of G-forces, which would destroy the craft and kill any human pilot.[^1]

**Low Observability:** UAP are often difficult to detect with conventional sensor systems. They can appear and disappear from radar, and they often lack the visual, thermal, or acoustic signatures of known aircraft. This has led to the theory that they may employ some form of cloaking or stealth technology.[^1]

**Transmedium Travel:** UAP have been observed moving seamlessly between different environments, such as space, the atmosphere, and water, without any discernible change in performance. They have been seen entering and exiting the ocean without splashing or losing speed.[^1]

**Antigravity:** UAP appear to be able to defy the effects of gravity, hovering motionless for extended periods and moving without any visible means of propulsion or lift, such as wings, rotors, or propellers.[^1]

### The Sixth Observable

In addition to the five primary observables, [[Luis Elizondo]] has identified a sixth: **Biological Effects**. This refers to the physiological and medical effects that UAP encounters can have on humans, including radiation-like burns, neurological damage, and other unexplained medical conditions.[^1]

### Significance

The Five Observables provide a framework for analyzing UAP encounters and for identifying objects that exhibit truly anomalous performance characteristics. They have been a key tool for investigators and have helped to legitimize the UAP issue as a serious national security concern. The observables were also the foundation for [[Hal Puthoff]]'s unified theory of UAP propulsion, which posits that all five characteristics can be explained by a single technology that can warp space-time.[^1]
