[[Animate Physics]] is a term used to describe the study of physical phenomena related to living organisms, particularly in the context of consciousness and [[Psi|psi]] abilities. It contrasts with "inanimate physics," which focuses on non-living matter.[^1]

[[Hal Puthoff]] became interested in animate physics, seeking to understand how quantum theory might account for biological life processes and the source of human energy. He explored the idea that there might be fields and forces involved in biological systems that are not accounted for in traditional physics, such as the theoretical subatomic particle, the tachyon.[^1]
