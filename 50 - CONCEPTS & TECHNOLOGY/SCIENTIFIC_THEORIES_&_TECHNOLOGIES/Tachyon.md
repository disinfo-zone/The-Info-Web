A [[Tachyon]] is a hypothetical subatomic particle that travels faster than the speed of light. In theoretical physics, tachyons are not forbidden by quantum physics, and their existence has been explored as a potential explanation for phenomena that seem to defy conventional understanding.[^1]

[[Hal Puthoff]] became interested in tachyons as a possible explanation for the unknown energy field or force that might be involved in [[Animate Physics]] and [[Psi|psi]] abilities. He hypothesized that if tachyons existed, they could provide a mechanism for instantaneous communication or influence, which could account for phenomena like [[ESP]] and [[Psychokinesis]].[^1]
