The "[[Giggle Factor]]" is a term used in intelligence communities to describe the skepticism and ridicule associated with [[Parapsychology|paranormal]] research and its potential operational use. It represents the fear of embarrassment and professional compromise if it became widely known that an intelligence agency was consulting psychics or relying on psychic data.[^1]

In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], the giggle factor was a significant obstacle to the program's acceptance and funding. [[Norm Everheart]] of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] used this term to describe the concerns of his superior, [[Ed Rogers]], the chief of [[Staff D]]. Despite impressive demonstrations of [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] accuracy by psychics like [[Pat Price]], Rogers ultimately decided against using psychic intelligence for high-stakes operations, fearing the ridicule and operational compromise that would ensue if his office was perceived as "reading tea leaves."[^1]

The secrecy surrounding the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program was designed not only to protect it from Soviet eyes but also, perhaps more importantly, to protect its supporters from the "sheer mortification and embarrassment they would feel if the program were exposed. Psychics in the Pentagon! The Army's crystal ball gazers!"[^1]
