[[Human Use Experimentation]] refers to the ethical and regulatory framework governing research involving human subjects, particularly in military and intelligence contexts. The dark history of such experimentation in the military, notably programs like [[Project MKUltra]], which involved controversial studies of LSD and other potential "mind control" drugs on servicemen, led to strict requirements for informed consent and oversight by human use review boards.[^1]

In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], the remote viewing program was categorized as human use experimentation. This meant that participants like [[Mel Riley]] and others had to fill out extensive informed consent paperwork, and the project required approval and oversight from the Army's human use review board. This regulatory scrutiny, while causing delays, was a direct consequence of past abuses and aimed to protect the rights and well-being of the psychic subjects.[^1]

Concerns about the potential psychological effects of prolonged remote viewing, such as mental fatigue and emotional fragility, also fell under the purview of human use experimentation oversight, with psychologists like Dr. Dick Hartsell initially involved in evaluating the psychics' mental stability.[^1]
