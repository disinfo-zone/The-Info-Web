A [[Human Use Review Board]] (also known as an Institutional Review Board or IRB) is a committee responsible for reviewing and approving research involving human subjects to ensure ethical standards and participant safety. These boards are a direct consequence of past abuses in human experimentation, such as those seen in [[Project MKUltra]] and Nazi medical experiments.[^1]

In the context of the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], the remote viewing program was categorized as [[Human Use Experimentation]], requiring the establishment of a Human Use Review Board within the [[U.S. Army]] to oversee its activities. This ensured that participants provided informed consent and that the research adhered to ethical guidelines.[^1]
