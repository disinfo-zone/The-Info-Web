PSI-INT, or psi-derived intelligence, refers to information gathered through psychic phenomena such as [[remote viewing]], used for intelligence purposes. It is a term coined to categorize psychic intelligence alongside other traditional intelligence disciplines like [[Human Intelligence|HUMINT]], PHOTINT (photographic intelligence), SIGINT (signals intelligence), and ELINT (electronic intelligence).[^1]

Proponents of PSI-INT, particularly within the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] program, argued that it could provide accurate data and serve as a valuable supplement to conventional intelligence sources, especially when traditional methods were limited or politically sensitive. The concept gained traction within the U.S. intelligence community, particularly during the [[Jimmy Carter]] administration, when there was a preference for "clean" spying methods.[^1]
