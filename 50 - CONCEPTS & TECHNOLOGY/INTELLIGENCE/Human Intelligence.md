Human Intelligence (HUMINT) refers to intelligence gathered by means of interpersonal contact, such as through foreign agents and their case officers. It is often considered the "second-oldest profession" in the world of espionage.[^1]

During the mid-1970s, following a series of scandals and increased congressional scrutiny, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] under [[Stansfield Turner]] reduced its reliance on HUMINT, favoring more "arm's-length" collection techniques like satellite photography and communications intercepts. This shift inadvertently made psychic intelligence, or [[PSI-INT]], seem like an appealing alternative for intelligence gathering.[^1]
