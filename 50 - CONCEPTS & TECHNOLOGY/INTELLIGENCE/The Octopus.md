The Octopus is a term coined by investigative journalist [[Danny Casolaro]] to describe a complex, interconnected network of organized crime, drug trafficking, money laundering, and pirated software. Casolaro believed this network involved various entities, including a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] 'Old Boy' network, the [[Wackenhut Corporation]], and the [[PROMIS Software Scandal|PROMIS]] software.[1]

Casolaro's investigation suggested that the origins of this cabal could be traced back to the Cold War era, with its tentacles extending into various government agencies and private corporations. The term was also used by Dan Moldea in his 1986 book, *Dark Victory: Ronald Reagan, MCA, and the Mob*, where he labeled [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] as "The Octopus."[1]
