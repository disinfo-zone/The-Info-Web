ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) is a category of intelligence gathering that involves the interception and analysis of electronic signals, excluding communications intelligence (COMINT). This often includes things like the radar signatures of enemy air defense systems and telemetry signals for missiles and satellites.[^1]

ELINT's boundaries often blur with those of [[SIGINT/COMINT]] and [[PHOTINT/IMINT]]. Like other intelligence disciplines, ELINT data is used in conjunction with other sources to confirm and complement information, and the emergence of [[PSI-INT]] offered another potential avenue for intelligence collection.[^1]
