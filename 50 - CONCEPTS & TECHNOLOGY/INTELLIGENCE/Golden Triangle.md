The [[Golden Triangle]] is a region in Southeast [[Asia]], primarily encompassing parts of [[Myanmar]], [[Laos]], and [[Thailand]], historically known as one of the world's largest opium-producing areas. It has been a significant hub for drug trafficking, particularly heroin, and has been linked to various intelligence operations and covert activities.[^1]

[[Danny Casolaro]]'s investigation into "[[The Octopus]]" included a focus on the Golden Triangle's drug trade. He was investigating [[Bo Gritz]]'s expose of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] drug trafficking in the region and sought information on Laotian warlord [[Kuhn Sa]]'s Golden Triangle drug trade proposal to the [[United States]].[^1]

[[Robert Booth Nichols]]' name was associated with the illegal transportation of narcotics through the Golden Triangle, and this connection tied into Casolaro's final inquiry. [[Michael Hand]], co-founder of [[Nugan Hand Bank]], and [[Bo Gritz]], both highly decorated Special Forces Green Berets in [[Vietnam]], had special knowledge of intelligence operations in the Golden Triangle.[^1]

[[Nugan Hand Bank]], a primary [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operation in the Pacific area, reportedly laundered profits from drug trafficking in the Golden Triangle. These laundered profits, in turn, financed subversive paramilitary activities in Southeast [[Asia]]. The bank collapsed in 1980, $5 billion in debt, and [[Michael Hand]] disappeared.[^1]

[[Allan Boyak]], an attorney, described [[Robert Booth Nichols]]' rum importing business as a cover for large-scale heroin trafficking from the Golden Triangle.[^1]
