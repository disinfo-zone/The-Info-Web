"[[Eight-Martini Results]]" is a term coined within the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to describe highly accurate and unsettling [[PSI-INT|psychic intelligence]] that is so inexplicable it drives intelligence officers to drink. The term implies that the information received through [[Remote Viewing]] or other [[Psi|psi]] means is so precise and unexpected that it challenges conventional understanding and can be deeply unsettling for those who receive it.[^1]

[[Pat Price]]'s remote viewing of the Chinese Embassy in Africa, where he accurately described details that were known only to a few intelligence officers, was described as an "eight-martini evening" by [[Nick Clancy]], a CIA officer. Similarly, [[Joe McMoneagle]]'s accurate remote viewing of the Soviet Typhoon-class submarine was considered an "intelligence first" and an example of an eight-martini result for the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[STARGATE PROJECT|Grill Flame]] unit.[^1]
