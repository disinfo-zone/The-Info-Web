PHOTINT (Photographic Intelligence), also known as IMINT (Imagery Intelligence), is a form of intelligence gathering that relies on photographic and other imagery, typically obtained from reconnaissance satellites or spy planes. This includes visible-light images, thermal infrared images, gamma-ray images, and even wall- and ground-penetrating radar images.[^1]

PHOTINT is one of the major "conventional" intelligence disciplines, alongside [[Human Intelligence|HUMINT]], [[SIGINT/COMINT]], and [[ELINT]]. While powerful, intelligence consumers prefer not to rely on solitary sources of information, using different intelligence disciplines together to confirm and complement each other. The advent of [[PSI-INT]] offered another potential source of intelligence to supplement these traditional methods.[^1]
