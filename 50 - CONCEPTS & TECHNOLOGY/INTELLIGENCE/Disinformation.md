[[Disinformation]] is false information deliberately and often covertly spread in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth. In the context of the *Remote Viewers* narrative, disinformation plays a significant role, particularly concerning the origins of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Parapsychology|psi]] research program.[^1]

The sensational 1960 French magazine article, [[The Nautilus (Telepathy Project)|"The Secret of the Nautilus"]], which claimed successful telepathic communication with the USS Nautilus submarine, was later suggested to be a fabrication or a disinformation ploy. Its purpose may have been to stir up valuable data about any American psi research or to encourage the Soviets to undertake wasteful research on psi, or both. Despite being debunked in the West, the Soviets seemingly believed the story, leading to a significant increase in their own psi research efforts.[^1]

Disinformation can be a powerful tool in intelligence operations, capable of influencing adversary actions and perceptions, even if based on false premises. The *Remote Viewers* narrative highlights how a single piece of disinformation can have far-reaching and unintended consequences in the realm of intelligence and scientific research.[^1]
