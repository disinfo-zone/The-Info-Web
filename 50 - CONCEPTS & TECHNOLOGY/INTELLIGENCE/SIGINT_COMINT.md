SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) covers the interception of virtually all electronic signals, while COMINT (Communications Intelligence) generally refers to signals from telephone or radio conversations. Led by the [[NSA]] SIGINT/COMINT rapidly became one of the most important intelligence-gathering technologies during the Cold War.[^1]

The sheer volume of data collected through SIGINT/COMINT often required heavy reliance on computers to automatically sift through intercepts for worthwhile material. Like other intelligence disciplines such as [[Human Intelligence|HUMINT]], [[PHOTINT/IMINT]], and [[ELINT]], SIGINT/COMINT was used in conjunction with other sources to confirm and complement information. The emergence of [[PSI-INT]] offered another potential avenue for intelligence collection.[^1]
