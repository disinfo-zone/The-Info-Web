KK MOUNTAIN was a code-name for one of the most sensitive operations of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] during the [[Cold War]]. It provided untold millions in annual cash payments to [[Mossad]], [[Israel]]'s primary foreign intelligence service. In return, [[Mossad]] authorized its agents to act, in essence, as American surrogates throughout North [[Africa]] and in countries like [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], and the [[Congo]]. Some of the programs under KK MOUNTAIN were financed off the shelf by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] contingency funds.[^1]
