I&W, standing for intelligence and warning, refers to intelligence that depicts military activity or other potentially threatening actions. This type of intelligence carries the highest classification marking in the American intelligence community. For example, KH-11 imagery provided to [[Israel]] depicting military activity inside the border of [[Israel]]'s four neighbors was considered I&W.[^1]
