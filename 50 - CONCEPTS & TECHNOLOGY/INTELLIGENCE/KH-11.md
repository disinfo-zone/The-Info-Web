KH-11 is a type of reconnaissance satellite developed by the [[United States]]. The first KH-11 was launched on December 19, 1976. Its images were capable of being digitally relayed to ground stations in real-time for instant analysis by the intelligence community. The KH-11 was considered an astonishing leap in technology, with its superb optical resolution.[^1]

Access to the high-quality imagery from the KH-11 was tightly restricted, even to close allies like [[Great Britain]]. However, in March 1979, President [[Jimmy Carter]] decided to provide [[Israel]] with access to KH-11 photographs. This agreement gave [[Israel]] access to satellite intelligence dealing with troop movements or other potentially threatening activities up to one hundred miles inside the borders of neighboring [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]]. This decision disrupted the satellite's careful scheduling and meant less access for some American intelligence agencies.[^1]

Following the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at [[Osirak bombing|Osirak]] in June 1981, [[William J. Casey]], Director of Central Intelligence, authorized a review of [[Israel]]'s use of the KH-11 intelligence-sharing agreement. The review found that [[Israel]] had expanded the agreement to extract virtually any photograph desired, including extensive coverage of western [[Russia]] and [[Moscow]]. Despite this, it was agreed that photographs would continue to flow to [[Israel]], but with the initial 1979 restrictions re-enforced.[^1]
