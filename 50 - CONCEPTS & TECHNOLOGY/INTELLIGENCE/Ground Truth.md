[[Ground Truth]] refers to information that is known to be true or accurate through direct observation or measurement. In the context of intelligence and scientific research, it is used to verify or calibrate other forms of data, particularly those obtained through less conventional means.[^1]

In the [[STARGATE PROJECT|Stargate Project]], ground truth was crucial for validating the accuracy of [[Remote Viewing]] sessions. For example, after remote viewers provided impressions of a target, their descriptions would be compared against satellite imagery or on-site reconnaissance to determine their accuracy. [[Dale Graff]] considered his profound [[Out-of-Body Experience|out-of-body experience]] at Bellows Beach to be "ground truth," a real situation that defied conventional explanation and spurred his interest in paranormal phenomena.[^1]
