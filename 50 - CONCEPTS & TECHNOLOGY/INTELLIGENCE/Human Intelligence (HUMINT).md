Human Intelligence (HUMINT) refers to intelligence gathered from human sources. [[James Jesus Angleton]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s director of counterintelligence, was known for his forte in HUMINT. However, analysts in the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]'s Office of National Estimates (ONE) often did not find his HUMINT sources reliable, particularly concerning [[Dimona]] and [[Israel]]'s nuclear weapons progress.[^1]
