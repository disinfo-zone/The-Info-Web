The [[USS Roosevelt]] (CVN-71) is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier of the United States Navy. In 2014 and 2015, the [[USS Roosevelt]] Carrier Strike Group was at the center of a series of prolonged and deeply concerning encounters with [[Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena]] (UAP) off the coast of the Southeastern United States, from Virginia to Florida.[^1]

### The 2014-2015 Encounters

During its pre-deployment workups, the aircrew of the [[USS Roosevelt]] experienced twenty-two separate encounters with UAP over a period of several months. These encounters were documented through multiple sensor systems, including newly upgraded radar systems on the F/A-18 Super Hornets, as well as pilot eyewitness testimony. The objects observed were varied, ranging from small, beach-ball-sized orbs to much larger craft. They flew both individually and in synchronized formations, exhibiting performance characteristics that far exceeded known technology, including the ability to fly for more than twelve hours without refueling.[^1]

One of the most alarming incidents involved a near-mid-air collision. Two F/A-18s flying in a tight formation were suddenly split by a UAP that flew directly between them. The pilots were able to get a clear look at the object, describing it as a transparent sphere with a dark cube suspended inside it. This and other encounters caused significant concern among the pilots and crew, who filed numerous safety reports, fearing for their lives and the safety of their aircraft.[^1]

### Investigation and Aftermath

The incidents were reported to the Navy's Fleet Forces Command, which then brought the matter to the attention of [[Jay Stratton]] and the [[Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program]] (AATIP). The encounters with the [[USS Roosevelt]] became a major focus for the program, and the data collected, including the now-famous "GIMBAL" and "GoFast" videos, was used to bolster the case for a more robust investigation into the UAP threat. The "GIMBAL" video is particularly notable for showing a UAP rotating in mid-air against a 120-knot headwind, a feat that is impossible for any known aircraft.[^1]

The Roosevelt incidents, like the [[Tic Tac Incident]] before them, highlighted the ongoing and escalating nature of UAP incursions into sensitive military airspace. The data and testimony from these encounters were crucial in the efforts by [[Luis Elizondo]] and [[Christopher Mellon]] to educate members of Congress and push for greater transparency and a more serious approach to the UAP issue.[^1]
